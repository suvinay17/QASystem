   Spuds MacKenzie, fun-loving party dog from
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., meet your new partner: Shamu, that
well-known killer whale.
   Anheuser-Busch announced Thursday it agreed to pay $1.1 billion
for the four Sea World parks around the country plus two other
theme parks from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
   ``We have considered Sea World as the ideal acquisition for some
period of time,'' said W. Randolph Baker, vice president and group
executive for Anheuser Busch.
   The deal will make the brewer the second largest theme park
operator in America behind Walt Disney Co., and will help Harcourt
pay off the huge debt the publishing and insurance company
accumulated in thwarting a hostile takeover two years ago.
   But Wall Street apparently was displeased with the deal.
Harcourt stock had plunged $3.87{ a share to $12.37{ in early
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Stock analysts who follow Anheuser-Busch applauded the
acquisition, but said it will have very little impact on the St.
Louis-based company's profits or makeup.
   ``This is a real drop in the beer barrel, but it's a
diversification move that's going to work and that's better than
one that doesn't work,'' said Julie Neiman, a St. Louis-based
analyst for Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co. Inc.
   Anheuser-Busch, the world's leading beer maker, has four core
businessess: beer, food, container manufacturing and family
entertainment. However, 90 precent of the company's sales come from
beer and beer-related ventures.
   ``The Sea World acquisition will give us a broad base for future
expansion,'' said Baker. He said the purchase should be completed
in November.
   Anheuser-Busch already operates Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla.,
one of the biggest zoos in the country; a 17th century
European-style park in Williamsburg, Va.; a water park in Tampa;
and a futuristic children's park near Philadelphia.
   The company also is planning a major theme park and resort in
Spain, along the Mediterranean coast just south of Barcelona,
according to Baker. It's scheduled to open in 1992 or 1993.
   The popular Sea World parks, which feature performing killer
whales, trained dolphins and other talented creatures from the sea,
are located in San Diego; Orlando, Fla.; San Antonio, Texas; and
Aurora, Ohio.
   The other parks involved in the deal are Boardwalk and Baseball
in Orlando and Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Fla. The purchase
also includes land adjacent to the three Florida parks, the Sea
World of Texas and the Orlando airport.
   Overall attendance at the parks was 14.5 million last year.
   Analysts say Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, a leading textbook
publisher, is selling the parks in an effort to pay off a nearly
$2.9 billion debt it accumulated when the Orlando-based company
fended off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt by British
communications mogul Robert Maxwell.
   ``They (Harcourt Brace) didn't have a whole lot of choice,''
said Robert Dunlap Jr., analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York.
   But in giving up the theme park business, Harcourt Brace also is
relieving itself of chronic management problems and falling
attendance at the six parks.
   In 1988, sales at the parks totaled $388 million and pre-tax
earnings were $62 million. This year pre-tax earnings were
projected to rise to $90 million, analysts said.
   Only two bidders for the park actually went public with their
plans. One was a group of former Harcourt Brace and Sea World
executives led by Sea World founder George Millay. The other was
Florida Leisure Acquisition Corp., which owns the Silver Springs
attraction in Ocala.
   Harcourt Brace has been in the theme park business for 13 years.
   The purchase price of $1.1 billion includes $975 for the theme
parks and the rest for the Harcourt Brace's land holdings. The
agreement also calls for Harcourt Brace to receive half of the
profits over $100 million from any sale of this land.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. announced Thursday it
had agreed to pay $1.1 billion for the four Sea World parks around
the country plus two other theme parks from Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc.
   The deal will make Anheuser-Busch the second largest theme park
operator in America, behind Walt Disney Co., and will help Harcourt
pay off the massive debt it accumulated in thwarting a hostile
takeover two years ago.
   ``We think this acquisition is a very logical move for
Anheuser-Busch,'' said August A. Busch III, chairman and president
of the company. ``We have been involved in the family entertainment
industry for the last 30 years and it is a business we know well.''
   The purchase was expected to be completed in November.
   Anheuser-Busch, the world's leading brewery, operates Busch
Gardens in Tampa, Fla., one of the biggest four zoos in the
country; a 17th century European-style park in Williamsburg, Va.; a
water park in Tampa and a futuristic children's park near
Philadelphia.
   The company also is planning a major theme park and resort along
the Spanish Mediterranean coast just south of Barcelona, according
to Vicki Pearlman, a spokeswoman for Anheuser-Busch. The park is
scheduled to open in 1992 or 1993.
   Family entertainment is one of Anheuser-Busch's four core
businesses along with beer, food and container manufacturing.
   The popular Sea World parks, which feature performing killer
whales such as the famous Shamu, trained dolphins and other sea
creatures, are located in San Diego; Orlando, Fla.; San Antonio,
Texas; and Aurora, Ohio.
   The other parks involved in the deal are Boardwalk and Baseball
in Orlando and Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Fla. The purchase
also includes land surrounding the three Florida parks and Sea
World of Texas.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, Anheuser-Busch
stock closed up 62{ cents at $42.25, while Harcourt Brace rose 62{
cents to close at $16.25.
   Analysts say Orlando-based Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, a leading
book publisher, is selling the parks in an effort to pay off a
nearly $2.9 billion debt it accumulated in fending off a 1987
hostile takeover attempt by British communications mogul Robert
Maxwell.
   ``They (Harcourt Brace) didn't have a whole lot of choice,''
said Robert Dunlap Jr., analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York.
   But in giving up the theme park business, Harcourt Brace also is
relieving itself of the chronic management problems and falling
attendance at the six parks.
   Attendance at the six parks dropped nearly 5 percent last year,
due in part to bad weather, but the decline has continued this
year, a company spokesman said.
   In 1988, sales at the parks were $388 million and pre-tax
earnings were $62 million, Anheuser-Busch said.. This year pre-tax
earnings were projected to rise to $90 million, analysts said.
   Although published reports earlier this month identified
Anheuser-Busch as the likely buyer of the parks, only two bidders
for the park actually went public with their plans. One was a group
of former Harcourt Brace and Sea World executives led by Sea World
founder George Millay. The other was from Florida Leisure
Acquisition Corp., which owns the Silver Springs attraction in
Ocala.
   Harcourt Brace has been in the theme park business for 13 years.
   The purchase price of $1.1 billion includes $975 million for the
theme parks and the rest for the Harcourt Brace's land holdings.
The agreement also calls for Harcourt Brace to receive half of the
profits over $100 million from any sale of the undeveloped land
included in the deal.

<HEAD>HBJ Cuts List of Possible Buyers; Anheuser-Busch a Front-Runner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The list of potential buyers for six theme
parks owned by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. has been narrowed to
six, and analysts expect a selection may come within a month,
according to a published report Wednesday.
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the St. Louis-based beer-maker and
owner of Busch Gardens theme parks, including one in Tampa, is the
front-runner and most likely buyer, a source close to the
negotiations told The Orlando Sentinel. Others on the list
reportedly include Walt Disney Co., based in Burbank, Calif.
   Potential buyers are being escorted this week and next through
the theme parks and have received a detailed package of financial
information, the Sentinel reported.
   ``I think they are getting much closer to making a transaction on
the parks,'' said Joe Frazzano, an analyst who follows HBJ for
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., a New York brokerage, told the newspaper. ``I
think they will certainly have an announcement within a month or
so.''
   A call for comment on the report was placed to HBJ but it was not
returned.
   But Robert Evanson, HBJ's executive vice president for parks, has
previously said the sale would be announced by Sept. 30, the end of
HBJ's third fiscal quarter.
   Spokesmen for Anheueser-Busch and Disney each said they do not
comment on speculation about acquisitions.
   Orlando-based HBJ announced in June the parks would be sold to
pay down some of the debt incurred two years ago defending itself
against a hostile takeover attempt by British publisher Robert
Maxwell. Industry analysts estimate the parks will garner at least
$1.3 billion.
   The Sea World parks being sold are in Orlando; San Diego; San
Antonio, Texas, and Aurora, Ohio. Also on the block are venerable
Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven and Boardwalk and Baseball near
Haines City.
   Nearly 25 prospective buyers were sent an initial packet of
financial information and projections about six weeks ago. Another
packet was distributed in the past two weeks to prospective buyers
with adequate financial backing and that HBJ considers ``serious.''
   Three former Sea World executives _ George Millay, Jan Schultz
and Robert Hillebrecht _ last month said they would make a bid for
the parks.
   Florida Leisure Acquisition Corp., which owns the Silver Springs
and Weeki Wachee attractions in Florida, said last week it's also
interested. The former Sea World group and Florida Leisure would not
say how much they had bid.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. has emerged as the
most likely buyer of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s theme parks as
talks intensified between the two companies this week, according to
news reports.
   HBJ has been negotiating with the giant brewing company to accept
HBJ's chief executive officer, Ralph D. Caulo, to run the parks, but
Anheuser-Busch wants to install its own chief executive, a source
close to the deal told The Orlando Sentinel for today's editions.
   The problem is that Anheuser-Busch ``doesn't want him,'' said
Ivan Obolensky, an analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co., a New York
brokerage. Obolensky said Caulo's background is in publishing, HBJ's
key business, and not in theme parks.
   Business Week magazine reports in its Sept. 25 issue that
Anheuser-Busch earlier this month began preparing a second round of
bids for Harcourt's theme parks, which it said are expected to fetch
from $1.2 billion to $2 billion.
   Talks between Orlando-based HBJ and St. Louis-based
Anheuser-Busch have reached a higher level of intensity in the past
few days, the Orlando Sentinel said.
   HBJ has said it hopes to complete a sale of its parks by the end
of September.
   On June 20, HBJ said it would sell its six theme parks, including
Sea Worlds in Orlando, Fla.; San Diego; San Antonio; and Aurora,
Ohio; Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Fla.; and Boardwalk and
Baseball near Haines City, Fla.
   The parks employ more than 7,000 people during the peak summer
months and full-time employment year-round is nearly 3,500.
   Analysts say companies reported to have bid for the theme parks
include Walt Disney Co.; MCA Inc.; Florida Leisure Acquisition
Corp., which owns the Silver Springs attraction near Ocala; and
Wesray Capital Corp. of Morristown, N.J., which owns 80 percent of
Six Flags Corp.
   Also, a group of three former HBJ and Sea World executives have
said they made a bid for the parks.
   HBJ wants to sell the parks to pay off some of the $2.9 billion
in debt that it acquired in warding off a bitter takeover attempt by
British publisher Robert Maxwell in 1987.
   Elizabeth Bramwell, an analyst for Gabelli &amp; Co., a New York
brokerage, said she is not aware that an agreement between HBJ and
Anheuser-Busch is imminent, but ``it would be a strategically
brilliant move for Anheuser-Busch. I think it would be a very good
fit.''
   Anheuser-Busch, the nation's largest brewer with well-known
brands including Budweiser, Bud Light and Michelob, is also a
successful operator of the Busch Gardens theme parks.
   Anheuser-Busch spokeswoman Robyn Meyer would not comment on
reports that a deal between HBJ and Anheuser-Busch is near.
   Margaret Mary McQuillan, senior vice president and spokeswoman
for HBJ, said she had ``no information'' about a deal between
Anheuser-Busch and HBJ, adding that ``there is nothing to report.''
   HBJ's stock fell 12{ cents a share Thursday to close at $15.87{
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   HBJ wants Caulo to work for the parks' buyer because William
Jovanovich, HBJ's iron-willed and autocratic chairman, eventually
wants to put his son, Peter, at the company's helm, a source close
to the discussions told the Sentinel.
   Caulo, 54, outranks Peter Jovanovich, 40, who is an executive
vice president, but Caulo is outranked by William Jovanovich, 69.
   A secretary in Caulo's office said he was not available for
comment.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos., angling to triple its theme park business, landed Shamu the killer whale and six parks from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. through a definitive accord valued at $1.1 billion. 

   The St. Louis-based brewing giant, which operates Busch Gardens theme parks in Tampa, Fla., and Williamsburg, Va., had emerged in recent weeks as the most likely buyer of the Sea World and other theme parks that the financially ailing publisher and insurance company put on the block last June. 
The sale is expected to be completed in November, Anheuser-Busch said. 

   Although Harcourt, based in Orlando, Fla., reportedly was flooded with bids for the parks, the purchase price came in on the low end of estimates that ranged as high as $2 billion. 

   In part because of the low purchase price, Wall Street analysts are paring their 1990 earnings estimate only slightly for Anheuser-Busch. 
Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for PaineWebber in San Francisco, said the purchase would probably dilute 1990 earnings about 3%. 

   Accordingly, Mr. Goldman lowered his earnings estimate yesterday for 1990 to $3.13 a share from $3.20 a share. 

   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Anheuser-Busch common stock closed up 62.5 cents, at $42.25. 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich also closed up 62.5 cents, at $16.25. 

   Although Harcourt is selling the theme parks for less than expected, the sale should significantly improve its financial position. 
Harcourt said it would use $930 million of initial net proceeds to pay some of its $1.12 billion of long-term bank debt. 

   That lump payment should lower Harcourt's interest bill by roughly $115 million a year, said John Berardi, Harcourt's senior vice president and treasurer. 
In contrast, after annual capital expenditures, the parks had generated only about $75 million of cash for debt service, said Mr. Berardi. 

   "It will free us of a whole lot of debt, and allow management to have both the time and resources to dedicate to our primary publishing business," he said. 

   Although theme parks are a small part of Anheuser-Busch's business, the acquisition was attractive because it allows the nation's biggest beer producer to combine the marketing of its Tampa Busch Gardens theme park with three Harcourt parks near Orlando. 

   What's more, beverage industry analysts figure that Anheuser-Busch has the marketing talent and advertising muscle to exploit here and overseas the recognition value of each Sea World's Shamu the killer whale. 

   In addition to Anheuser-Busch, other bidders for Harcourt's theme parks were said to have included MCA Inc. and Walt Disney Co. 

   Industry analysts estimate that the acquisition will triple the size of Anheuser-Busch's theme park business, which generated 1988 revenue of about $175 million. 
The Harcourt theme parks generated revenue last year of $388 million. 
In addition to Orlando, Harcourt operated Sea World parks in San Antonio, Texas, Aurora, Ohio, and San Diego, Calif. 
The sale also includes its Boardwalk and Baseball park in Orlando and its Cypress Gardens park in Winter Haven, Fla. 

   Anheuser-Busch paid $975 million for the six theme parks, which had 14 million vistors last year, and about $125 million for land surrounding some of the parks. 
Analysts expect Anheuser-Busch to sell some of that land. 

   Under terms of the purchase accord, Harcourt is entitled to some of the profit from any sales of undeveloped land in certain circumstances over the next 10 years. 

   About six million people attended Anheuser-Busch's theme parks last year. 
In addition to the two Busch Gardens parks, it operates a Tampa water park called Adventure Island and Sesame Place, a child-oriented park near Philadelphia. 
Anheuser-Busch is also building a theme park and resort in Spain. 

   The theme park sale is the bitter pill Harcourt has to swallow because of the expensive manner in which it fended off a hostile takover bid by British publishing giant Robert Maxwell two years ago. 
William Jovanovich, Harcourt's chairman, engineered a $2.9 billion recapitalization by borrowing more than $2 billion. 

   The company said after that maneuver that it would need more cash to cover debts, but, until it put the parks up for sale in June, it promised it wouldn't sell core assets. 

   "All along we said we didn't intend to sell assets," said Mr. Berardi. 
"When we made those statements, that was our intentions. 
But the business world changes." 

   Though the sale eases Harcourt's long-term bank obligations, the company still owes about $1.6 billion of junk-bond debt. 
Loan covenants require Harcourt to pay the bank debt before the high-yield notes, which, at upwards of 14% interest, are much more weighty than the bank debt, which carries a 12% interest rate. 

   Harrison Price, the theme-park consultant who did the original feasibility studies for Walt Disney's parks, said the price Harcourt received was lower than expected because of huge deferred-maintenance costs facing the new owner. 

   Mr. Price estimates Anheuser-Busch will have to invest at least $100 million to spruce up the Sea World parks -- which have turned a bit shabby from neglect during Harcourt's financial woes -- and to add new attractions. 

   "The parks were deteriorating," he said, "and Disney has put the fear of God in its Orlando competitors" with its popular four-day passes to the recently expanded Walt Disney World.

<HEAD>Harcourt Brace to Lay Off 750 Theme Park Workers</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The dismissal of 750 workers in six Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich Inc. theme parks around the country is part of a
``belt-tightening'' program by the parent of Sea World and other
facilities, executives said.
   The layoffs announced Tuesday affect about 10 percent of the
park system's 7,500 full-time employees, said Robert Evanson, a
senior vice president and chairman of Harcourt Brace's parks
operation. They include nearly 350 layoffs in Central Florida.
   ``Employee cuts are a routine part of any corporate
belt-tightening. We will be a more efficient company,'' said Dan
LeBlanc, a spokesman for San Diego Sea World in California, which
will lose about 150 employees.
   Orlando-based Harcourt Brace, a major publishing company,
reported a net loss of $62.9 million on revenue of $446.6 million
in the second quarter. The company repelled an unwelcome takeover
bid last year from British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell by
adopting a $3 billion recapitalization plan and plunging into debt
before selling off several assets.
   A total of 334 workers have received layoff notices at company
facilities in Central Florida, including 113 at Sea World, 161 at
Boardwalk and Baseball near Haines City and 60 at Cypress Gardens
in Winter Haven. An additional nine park support workers will be
laid off from corporate headquarters.
   About 215 employees were fired Tuesday at Sea World of Texas in
San Antonio. Harcourt Brace operates another Sea World in
Cleveland, but there was no word on job cuts there.
   The fired workers, ranging in experience from several months to
more than 15 years, will leave no later than Sept. 6.
   Departments involving care of the parks' animals and direct
services to park visitors were largely spared.
   ``The lines aren't going to be any longer at the food stands or
anything like that,'' said LeBlanc. ``Animals will continue to
receive the world-class care that they're used to. Those areas
barely have been touched.''
   Evanson, 51, was appointed to the park system chairmanship
Monday, replacing Jack O. Snyder, who resigned last month amid a
management reorganization.
   Evanson has been with Harcourt Brace since 1985 and previously
served as deputy for publishing. Without being specific, he said
the newer parks in Florida and Texas had the largest cutbacks.
   The company's theme parks employ about 7,500 full-time employees
and bring in seasonal help during the peak summer months to push
the system's work force to 11,000 or 12,000.
   Most of the temporary workers are laid off soon after Labor Day.
All of Tuesday's layoffs involved the permanent work force.
   Despite the layoffs, LeBlanc said Sea World's shows and other
attractions will remain unchanged.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. stock plunged Friday
amid warnings that the $1.1 billion paid for its theme parks would
do little to relieve the publisher's debt.
   Harcourt's stock price dropped more than 25 percent on the New
York Stock Exchange, falling $4.12{ a share to $12.12{.
   The Orlando-based textbook publisher took on $2.9 billion in
debt to fend off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt by British
communications mogul Robert Maxwell, and analysts say it now finds
itself squeezed to pay off the interest.
   Analysts had hoped Orlando-based Harcourt would get $1.5 billion
to $2 billion for the four Sea World and two other parks it sold to
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. on Thursday.
   The $1.1 billion sale price will net Harcourt about $930 million.
   ``I think people's expectations were too high for the selling
price of the theme parks,'' Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. analyst
Robert Dunlap said.
   When Harcourt first announced the intended sale, the company's
stock soared from $10 to $18.
   Dunlap said the sale would lower Harcourt's $346.6 million in
annual interest payments by $115 million.
   But the loss of the parks will cut into the income Harcourt
needs to pay the debts; as of June 30, the parks accounted for
$68.3 million of the company's $216.8 million in annual earnings,
and that share had been expected to increase.
   ``They don't have enough money to pay the interest,'' Dunlap
said. He said Harcourt needs to reduce annual interest payments to
under $150 million _ either by lowering payments another $80
million or selling assets of $800 million.
   Dunlap speculated that Harcourt could sell its insurance arm,
but other analysts said even that will not be enough.
   ``They don't have that much more to sell. Ultimately, they will
have to issue more equity,'' says Bert Boksen of Raymond, James &amp;
Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg.
   That will help reduce the debt but will dilute share values even
further, he said.
   ``We're still recommending selling the stock,'' Boksen said.
``We think it's worth somewhere near $8 to $9 a share.''
   He said Harcourt's breakup value is about $14 a share, and stock
in publishers should sell at about 60 percent of that price.
   Boksen added that more bad news may be in store for Harcourt,
noting that school publishing sales for all publishers were soft in
the third quarter.
   Harcourt officials did not return telephone calls seeking
comment.
   Harcourt's popular Sea World parks, which feature performing
killer whales such as Shamu, trained dolphins and other talented
creatures from the sea, are located in San Diego, Orlando, San
Antonio and Aurora, Ohio.
   The other parks involved in the deal are Boardwalk and Baseball
in Orlando and Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven. The purchase also
includes land adjacent to the three Florida parks, Sea World of
Texas and Orlando International Airport.
   Overall attendance at the six parks was 14.5 million last year.
   Prior to the theme park deal, Harcourt had annual sales of $1.5
billion, with the parks accounting for $388 million. The company
employed 17,500 people before the sale.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, trying to keep
its head above $2.6 billion in debt, has gone fishing for a new
owner for Shamu the killer whale and its Sea World theme parks.
   The Orlando-based publishing and entertainment giant also put up
for sale two other central Florida attractions, Boardwalk &amp; Baseball
and Cypress Gardens, plus all land holdings. Estimates of the worth
of the package ranged from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion.
   ``We know most every employee in the parks,'' HBJ's longtime
chairman, William Jovanovich, told reporters Tuesday. ``And it hurts
a little bit to think that you're going to say goodbye to part of
your family. But we're not going to do it unless it's done rightly.''
   Financial analysts say the sale of the parks will help beef up a
balance sheet weakened by huge debts acquired to repel an unfriendly
takeover attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell. To counter
Maxwell's unsolicited bid of $2 billion in May 1987, Harcourt
adopted a takeover defense that weighed it down with in debt.
   ``HBJ is about $2.6 billion in debt and has a deficit of $1.5
billion in stockholder equity ... so this is a positive development
for the company,'' said Robert Dunlap of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp;
Co. in New York.
   Harcourt was the second-most active issue on the New York Stock
Exchange on Tuesday following the morning announcement with 3.75
million shares changing hands. The stock rose $3.75 to close Tuesday
at $13.875.
   During the past two years, Harcourt has disposed of
trade-magazine and school-supply interests, streamlined its theme
parks division and reshuffled its publishing operations _ all of
which included huge reductions in personnel.
   But that wasn't enough, according to some analysts who had
foreseen the sale of an entire operating division as the only way to
pay off the debt.
   ``The first love of this company is publishing,'' said Elizabeth
Bramwell of the brokerage Gabelli &amp; Co. in New York. ``They
shouldn't have been doing all these (other) things.''
   The marine parks are in Orlando, San Diego, San Antonio, and
Aurora, Ohio, near Cleveland. Shamu is the stage name given to the
performing whales at the parks. The land for sale is about 1,000
acres in Florida and San Antonio.
   HBJ, the nation's largest textbook publisher, lost $126.5
million, or $2.04 a share, last year compared with a 1987 profit of
$64.4 million, or $1.34 a share.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. announced
today it will sell its Sea World theme parks in four states and two
other Florida attractions to help retire the huge debt it incurred
in fighting off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt.
   The sale of the Sea World marine parks in Florida, Texas, Ohio
and California and Boardwalk &amp; Baseball and Cypress Gardens in
Central Florida is the only way HBJ ``can substantially reduce the
company's obligations'' and make the necessary investments in its
publishing and insurance divisions, a company statement said.
   In midmorning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Harcourt
rose $3 a share to $13.12{ after the disclosure.
   The decision came about after recent talks between HBJ's
chairman, William Jovanovich, and its new president, Ralph D. Caulo,
according to the announcement.
   The statement said Caulo ``is prepared to leave HBJ in order to
manage these businesses under new ownership.''
   The brief announcement made no mention of a possible buyer for
the six parks, and a tract of land next to Orlando International
Airport.
   ``The HBJ directors have authorized this sale, which is subject
to the approval of HBJ's lenders,'' the statement said. ``Mr.
Jovanovich and Mr. Caulo have agreed that Mr. Caulo will direct the
sale of these assets, whether made to a corporation or to a
syndicate of investors.''
   There was no further comment from the company. Jovanovich was
unreachable for comment and Caulo did not immediately return
telephone calls to his office.
   HBJ, a Fortune 500 company and the nation's largest textbook
publisher, fought a hostile takeover by British publisher Robert
Maxwell in 1987 by adopting a costly defense known as a
recapitalization.
   It financed the plan by borrowing from banks and selling
so-called junk bonds, ballooning its debt to $2.9 billion.
   HBJ lost $126.5 million, or $2.04 a share, last year compared
with a 1987 profit of $64.4 million, or $1.34 a share. The loss came
despite increased sales of 17 percent, to a record $1.78 billion,
over 1987.
   The improved sales were caused by strong demand for HBJ's
textbooks and insurance policies, plus the opening of its new Sea
World theme park near San Antonio, Tex., according to analysts.
   During its first quarter, HBJ reported larger-than-usual losses
in its publishing division. It lost $46.2 million in the first three
months of the year, or nearly $19 million more than in the same
period a year earlier.
   The company recently underwent a reshuffling of that division,
relocating sales and marketing personnel and eliminating some 200
jobs.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. put its four
Sea World parks and two other attractions on the market Tuesday to
help extricate itself from a $2.5 billion debt brought on by a 1987
hostile takeover attempt.
   The company said selling the marine parks in Florida, Texas, Ohio
and California and Boardwalk &amp; Baseball and Cypress Gardens in
central Florida was the best way to meet debt obligations and
concentrate on its publishing and insurance divisions.
   Estimates of the value of the properties ranged from $1 billion
to $2.5 billion.
   Wall Street applauded the move. HBJ's stock closed up $3.75 a
share Tuesday to $13.87{ in active trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   ``It's a positive development for the company because of its weak
balance sheet,'' said Robert Dunlap, a securities analyst with Brown
Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. in New York. ``Clearly, something had to be
done.''
   Elizabeth Bramwell, of the New York firm Gabelli &amp; Co., said HBJ
``shouldn't have been doing all these (other) things. The first love
of this company is publishing.''
   HBJ, the nation's largest textbook publisher, has struggled with
a $2.9 billion recapitalization program over the past two years by
disposing of trade-magazine and school-supply interests,
streamlining its parks division and reshuffling its publishing
operations _ all of which included huge reductions in personnel.
   HBJ restructured its operations, through bank loans and high-risk
junk bonds, to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by British
publisher Robert Maxwell in 1987.
   The decision to sell the theme parks and real estate holdings
followed recent talks between HBJ's longtime chairman, William
Jovanovich, and the company's new president, Ralph D. Caulo,
according to a three-paragraph statement by HBJ.
   ``The HBJ directors have authorized this sale, which is subject
to the approval of HBJ's lenders,'' the announcement said.
   It added that Caulo ``is prepared to leave HBJ in order to manage
these businesses under new ownership.''
   The parks will be sold as a package to an investor that ``wants
to invest in them and continue to see them grow,'' Bob Evanson, head
of the theme parks division, said in an interview.
   Evanson said the company had spoken to ``quite a few'' potential
buyers of the parks, which brought in an estimated $388 million in
revenue last year, and a separate tract of land near Orlando
International Airport.
   Among the possible buyers mentioned by analysts, however, were:
Anheuser-Busch Cos., which owns Busch Gardens in Tampa; British
entertainment magnate Robert Earl, who has restaurant and nightclub
properties in the area; Paramount Studios, which reportedly is
interested in Boardwalk &amp; Baseball; and the prosperous Walt Disney
Co., which just opened its third theme park in the Orlando area.
   HBJ's trade-magazine and school-supply operations were sold to
Edgell Communications Inc. for $334 million in late 1987. That was
the beginning of the effort to repay some of the debt associated
with the costly takeover defense.
   HBJ lost $126.5 million last year compared with a 1987 profit of
$64.4 million, or $1.34 a share.
   The company paid about $313 million in interest last year.

<HL> Harcourt's Chief
May Consider Sale
Of Parks, Aide Says

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. Chairman William Jovanovich is "fed up" with the company's massive theme park business, and would sell it if someone were to offer $2.5 billion, Vice Chairman Robert Edgell said. 

   However, Mr. Edgell's remarks, which first appeared in a Duluth, Minn., newspaper, don't appear to indicate that the publishing, theme park and insurance concern has decided to put its park business on the block, as it has done with several smaller units to help pay for its controversial $3 billion recapitalization plan. 

   Instead, they appear to reflect Mr. Jovanovich's frustration over bad publicity that Orlando, Fla.-based Harcourt received after a whale trainer was injured by one of his charges in the company's Sea World theme park in San Diego. 

   "I think he's just fed up with the negative publicity," said another Harcourt official, who requested anonymity. 
The incident occured in November when a killer whale named Orky leaped out of the water and landed on his trainer, badly injuring him. 
The theme park's president, chief animal trainer and chief veterinarian were suspended in the wake of the incident. 
Harcourt also drew bad press last spring, when it purchased a rival aquatic park that had been home to Orky and his mate, Corky, and shipped the animals to San Diego. 
Devotees of the rival park charged Harcourt with piracy. 

   Mr. Edgell, who will leave Harcourt shortly to head a new company that has agreed to buy Harcourt's magazine unit and its school supplier, said Mr. Jovanovich expressed his frustrations in recent conversations. 
"I think he is fed up with the amusement and entertainment business," Mr. Edgell said in a telephone interview. 
"His first love is the learning business and books, not show business." 

   Mr. Jovanovich couldn't be reached for comment, but his secretary confirmed that he has held discussions recently with Mr. Edgell about the theme park business and that Mr. Edgell's remarks accurately reflect what was said. 

   Mr. Edgell said he gave his initial account of the conversations as an aside during an interview with the Duluth News-Tribune about his new business venture, and not as a statement about Harcourt's intentions. 
"I didn't say the place was for sale," he said. 

   Indeed, several analysts said they would be quite surprised if Harcourt did decide to sell the parks unit, which in 1986 had operating profit of $40.1 million, or 26.5%, of the company's $151.5 million in income from operations. 
The unit, which makes Harcourt the nation's second-largest theme park operator, includes three Sea World parks, and the Boardwalk and Baseball park and Florida Cypress Gardens park, both near Orlando. 
An additional Sea World park is currently under construction. 

   "It's surprising that they have decided maybe to get out of the business," said Robert Dunlap, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., a New York bank. 
He noted that Harcourt specifically stated in public filings that it didn't expect to put the unit on the auction block to help pay for its recapitalization plan. 
As previously reported, Harcourt devised the plan in May to escape a takeover bid by British media baron Robert Maxwell. 

   Mr. Edgell said the company doesn't need to sell its theme parks to pay for the recapitalization plan. 
The company has sold or agreed to sell assets valued at more than $370 million, which it has said fulfills its commitments to banks that agreed to finance the recapitalization. 

   The price mentioned by Mr. Edgell also provoked skepticism about Harcourt's seriousness. 
"I think Edgell said it jestingly," said Bert Boksen, chief investment officer of Raymond James &amp; Associates, a St. Petersburg, Fla., brokerage house. 
He said the parks are probably valued at no more than $700 to $800 million. 
He added, "I was at their plant two weeks ago and they emphatically denied that anything was for sale except for some surplus real estate."

Anheuser-Busch has agreed to spend $1.1 billion to buy the Sea World parks from 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, but it may have to share the marketing rights to 
their symbol, Shamu the killer whale. 
</P>
<P>
The Orlando-based HBJ already has a licensing agreement with Watson General 
Pictures of La Jolla, which created the cartoon "Shamu -- The Beginning" that 
has not yet appeared on television. 
</P>
<P>
Any proceeds from the animated special or merchandising spinoffs will be shared 
among Anheuser-Busch of St. Louis, Watson General Pictures and Watson's partner 
in the making of the movie, Lion's Den Venture. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch will also have to share profits, which analysts say could reach 
into the millions of dollars, from the marketing of other Sea World characters 
and animals, according to the licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch spokeswoman Vicki Pearlman said the company knew about Watson 
General Pictures when it agreed to purchase the parks from HBJ in September. 
The sale of the Sea World parks is set to close later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"The company was aware of the licensing agreement relating to the Shamu 
character," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One expert said Anheuser-Busch may try to buy the rights back from Watson 
General Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think Anheuser-Busch would want control of the characters," said Bert 
Boksen, who follows theme parks for the Raymond, James &amp; Associates 
regional brokerage in St. Petersburg. "Somebody else . . . could portray Shamu 
in a commercial drinking Miller beer." 
</P>
<P>
HBJ and Sea World officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Watson General Pictures' 1988 annual report indicates that the agreement gives 
Sea World royalties of 6% to 50% of proceeds from merchandising as well as a 
share in proceeds from the cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Watson General Pictures says in its 1988 annual report that its plans include 
"initiating of a worldwide marketing and merchandising program" to promote the 
photogenic killer whale as well as television specials, a feature film valued 
at $6 million to $8 million, and a children's TV series. 
</P>
<P>
The report also says that Watson has been approached by "a major merchandising 
company" that is interested in marketing the Shamu projects with the company. 
The company was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Pearlman would not say whether Anheuser-Busch has been in touch with Watson 
or has an interest in buying rights back from Watson.

   Baby Shamu is an orphan now. 
The infant killer whale, whose father died last year just days after she was born, lost her mother, Kandu, in a whale fight last Monday at Sea World in San Diego. 
The bloody event was on the network news, and a lot of people are grieving. 

   "Anybody who hasn't heard of Shamu must be living in an igloo," says Thomas Francis, a New York truck driver vacationing with his family at the Orlando, Fla., tourist haven that includes a Sea World theme park and Walt Disney World. 

   Actually, people living in igloos are probably more familar with killer whales than most other people, but Mr. Francis does have a point. 
In the booming theme park business, success requires a cast of identifiable characters amenable to marketing. 
And if millions know Shamu now, just wait till the trademarked character falls into the hands of whoever is about to pay a mint for her. 

   Look for the Shamu TV series sure to follow. 

   The peculiar dynamics of the theme park business were thrown into bold relief last June when Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., the debt-plagued publishing and insurance giant that owns the four Sea Worlds (the other two are in Aurora, Ohio, and San Antonio, Texas) announced the parks were for sale. 
Potential buyers from Japan, Europe and the U.S. have flooded Harcourt with inquiries, leading to predictions that the Sea Worlds, along with some other minor real-estate and amusement-park assets, could fetch up to $1.5 billion. 
That is more than 23 times what Harcourt paid for its first three Sea Worlds in 1976. 
Interested parties are said to include MCA Inc., Anheuser-Busch Cos., Walt Disney Co. and Wesray Capital Corp., 80%-owner of the Six Flags park chain. 

   All that money for an Aurora park that is closed eight months of the year yet requires year-round care of the marine mammals by their paid trainers. 
All that money for a brand-new, $200 million park in economically stressed San Antonio that analysts say is twice as big as the city can support. 
All that for two smaller parks near Orlando -- one called Boardwalk and Baseball, the other Cypress Gardens -- that "compete with each other, believe it or not," says Abraham Pizam, director of the Institute of Tourism Studies at the University of Central Florida. 

   The Orlando and San Diego Sea Worlds are far more successful properties, but what the buyers really are after is Shamu -- and the potential to take the lucrative, lovable character overseas. (Shamu actually is not one but several whales that perform under the name, a sort of Sea World generic.) 

   "The biggest market in the world right now is Japan, South Korean, Taiwan," says Larry Cochran, the president of Six Flags. 
Europe, Australia and Latin America are huge potential markets as well. 

   Theme parks depend for their business on creating a unique fantasy experience on which parents will lavish vacation money. 
Shamu (like the prototypical Mickey Mouse, who continues to enrich Disney) is an indispensable character of the sort that can be used to entertain visitors to the parks, to adorn the ubiquitous souvenirs, and to grace marketing blitzes for the parks and various consumer goods. 
Mickey Mouse on Pampers sells diapers. 

   Disney Chairman Michael Eisner says the use of characters isn't just an aspect of the company, "that is all our company is. 
We are nothing else." 

   Caroline Todd, an eight-year-old from Manchester, England, bolsters the point. 
She has never heard of the Statue of Liberty, the Golden Gate Bridge or the Grand Canyon. 
But this child with a broad smile and a Daisy Duck hat knows exactly what she wants from her trip to America: to meet Mickey Mouse and the gang at Walt Disney World. 

   "You hear of Disney everywhere in England," says Jean Todd, Caroline's mother. 
"It is America to us." 

   And there is no way not to spend money at a theme park. 
"How can you say no?" asks Tammy Enriquez of Miami, whose two-year-old son, Justin, can't say much of anything yet, but blurts out "Shamoooo" at the sight of his souvenir whale. 
Mrs. Enriquez says she and her husband, Felix, come back to Orlando every summer: That's where Justin was conceived, she says, on a trip to Sea World. 

   What MCA theme park chief Jay Stein calls the characters' "mesmerizing effect on children" is why most people go to theme parks -- and the proprietors know it. 
Mr. Eisner, since becoming chairman of Disney in 1984, has counted on parental love in jacking up ticket prices at Disney World nearly 100%, to $30 a day. 
This year a four-day ticket costs $100 per person. 

   "There isn't a lot of price resistance by tourists," says consultant John L. Gerner, of Economic Research Associates in Fort Lauderdale. 
"They've already invested a lot of money to come to the area, they've got the kids with them, and they're not going to turn around, especially if the park provides a unique experience." 

   Disney, of course, remains the undisputed master of character creation and exploitation, having parlayed its animated images into $4 billion a year in revenue from theme parks, movies, and consumer goods. 
On a given summer's day, some 150,000 people pass through the turnstiles of Disney's parks, estimates Tom Powell, the editor of Amusement Business magazine. 
They spend at least $10 each on food and souvenirs, he says, and they are happy, or at least willing, to stand in hour-long lines. 

   Under Mr. Eisner, Disney has pumped money into new attractions, including the hot Disney-MGM Studio at Walt Disney World, and the company has increased advertising and cross-promotional activities. 
By revitalizing Disney's film business, Mr. Eisner has greatly expanded the cross-marketing possibilities of Disney's parks, movies and TV shows. 

   Witness eight-year-old Ernie Ballesteros of Los Angeles, making his fourth trip to a Disney park, his first to Disney-MGM Studio. 
"Mom, Mom, you're not looking] Here's what Roger Rabbit did," he shouts, as he crashes his body repeatedly against a barrier at the end of some railroad tracks. 
Ernie is in Toontown, a reproduction of the animated ghetto where cartoon characters resided in the hit Disney film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." 

   Roger Rabbit is an "arriviste" among Disney characters, and the company is always on the prowl for more. 
Disney is reportedly on the brink of buying The Muppets from Henson Associates Inc. to further expand its stable of characters. 
Neither side will comment. 

   "We're one of the few companies in America where each of the pieces supports {the others}, and the sum of all these pieces makes them greater," says Mr. Eisner. 
"The television supports the motion pictures, which support the animation, which supports the parks." 

   The synergy has worked so well at Disney that others try to copy it. 
MCA is pouring $600 million into a Universal Studio park in Orlando where it hopes to capitalize on such popular characters as "E.T." and the shark from "Jaws." 
Whoever buys Sea World is likely to invest heavily in touting Shamu, if anything an underdeveloped character. 

   Sea World's parks could use a little work, too. 
Two years ago, Harcourt, which is based in Orlando, fought off a hostile takeover attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell, plunging the company into more than $2 billion of debt. 
The financial burden forced Harcourt to curtail spending on the Sea World attractions. 
The company fired 731 workers last year, or 10% of the parks' work force, and it cut marketing and advertising. 
Moreover, it hasn't built major new attractions since it added a penguin exhibit more than two years ago. 
Attendance, analysts say, has slipped as a result. 
"In this business, it's essential to reinvest," says Michael Demetrias, the president of Marine World-Africa USA in Vallejo, Calif., which is also looking for expansion money. 
A rule of thumb, he says, is that it takes an investment of between $5 million and $15 million in new attractions to increase attendance 10% to 20%. 
Six Flags' Mr. Cochran says his company spends $30 million a year for new attractions and an additional $23 million for maintenance, just to keep abreast of the competition in such markets as Texas and Southern California. 

   Harcourt's painful recapitalization merely added to what some company insiders believed was a deteriorating cash situation at its parks. 
In 1984, William Jovanovich, Harcourt's chairman, committed the company to building the largest of the four Sea Worlds in San Antonio, despite objections from Sea World executives. 
Determined to proceed with the only Harcourt-built park, Mr. Jovanovich killed a feasibility study by Harrison Price Co., a firm that did similar research for Disney's parks. 
Harrison Price favored a park half the size and cost of what Mr. Jovanovich envisioned, according to former Harcourt executives. 

   These executives say the Texas Sea World eventually cost nearly $200 million to build, putting it some $60 million over budget. 
Last year, they say, with heavy local promotions, discounting and some loose tabulating at the gate, the park drew 3.3 million visitors. 
This year, attendance is off about 40%, say the former insiders. 

   "The Texas situation had a tremendous impact on all the parks because it left a lot less money for new paint, maintenance and basic upkeep," says a former Sea World official. 
This is most clearly seen at Harcourt's Cypress Gardens outside Orlando. 
Driving up, a visitor, still dazzled by the order and spotlessness of Walt Disney World, is jolted by the rust coating the huge white letters spelling out the park's name on the front lawn. 
Inside, a jumble of wires and pipes protrudes from a dry fountain. 
In another corner, a sign reads: "Please Excuse the Mess. 
More Improvements Being Made." 

   Margaret Mary McQuillan, senior vice president and secretary of Harcourt, declines comment in behalf of the company and Mr. Jovanovich, citing the sale talks. 
Harcourt's president and chief executive, Ralph Caulo, who has said he would leave the company to run the parks for new owners, didn't return phone calls. 

   But it's Shamu, anyway, that buyers are after, not Cypress Gardens. 
It isn't just the trademark that is so valuable. 
Killer whales are hard to come by because of the rigid permit process now required to capture them in the wild. 
Kandu, who was killed last week, may have been worth $1 million. 
But Sea World still has 15 killer whales at its parks, including five young ones born in captivity. 

   The many inquiries that have come in from around the world about Sea World suggest that Shamu and the "fish park" concept could thrive overseas. 
With the Florida and Southern California areas awash in theme parks, with Texas still reeling economically and with the rest of the country less hospitable because of weather, theme-park people have reason to be looking abroad. 

   In Europe, parks definitely are taking off. 
Two large, $100 million-plus theme attractions recently opened in France, and Disney's $2 billion joint venture outside Paris is scheduled to open in 1992. 
In Spain, Anheuser-Busch is going ahead with plans for a $300 million park and resort complex near Barcelona, and Six Flags has a contract to develop a park on the Costa del Sol. 
MCA is looking at sites in Britain, France and Japan. 

   Sea World has tremendous domestic appeal, too. 
Theme-park watchers say both Anheuser-Busch and MCA could use the Harcourt parks to create cross-marketing and ticket packages with which to attack dominant Disney. 
Shamu in the hands of MCA, which owns Universal Studios and is building its theme park in Orlando, could be a natural for further exploitation on TV and film. 

   MCA won't comment on what interest it might have in Sea World, but officials acknowledge that promoting it in tandem with its new Orlando park, offering admission packages for both attractions, would make sense, given that Disney has long tried to monopolize the time tourists spend in Orlando. 

   Then, too, Busch's "Dark Continent" African and zoological park in Tampa is just 80 miles from Orlando. 
Though declining comment on Sea World, W. Randolph Baker, the president of Busch's entertainment unit, says the company wants to expand its park operations. 
They include a small park outside Philadelphia based on "Sesame Street," a Williamsburg, Va., park with a European village theme, and the zoo theme park in Tampa. 

   But Busch isn't in the same league as Disney and MCA when it comes to characters that can be exploited on TV. "Busch's parks will never be more than a public-relations arm of the company," claims a competitor. 
And though Busch balks at this characterization -- its parks are profitable, Mr. Baker says -- the first "Busch Gardens" began as a beer and bird park adjacent to the company's brewery in Van Nuys, Calif. 
When faced with the choice of keeping the gardens or expanding the plant to make more beer, beer won. 

   Disney too is said to have expressed an interest in Sea World, but it probably won't buy the parks because it prefers to build its own projects from scratch. 
The company won't comment. 
Acting as a bidder, Disney would get to see Harcourt's books, and if "they could make it more expensive for MCA to buy it, they'd be happy to do that," says Mara Balsbaugh, an entertainment analyst with Smith Barney. 

   The competition may sound a bit cutthroat for a business that thrives on making children smile. 
But Joseph Barbera, who with his partner William Hannah created "Yogi Bear" and "The Flintstones," says big business can hide small truths: "People love the characters because they're lovable," he says. 
"They don't take drugs. 
They don't drink." 
And, except now and then in Sea World's aquariums, they don't die.

<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., which recently
acquired the Sea World parks, has agreed to pay $6 million for
marketing rights to their star resident, Shamu the killer whale.
   The Shamu license is held by Watson General Pictures Inc. in a
joint venture with Lion's Den Productions Inc. The agreement to
sell the rights to Sea World Inc., a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch,
was made Thursday.
   Anheuser-Busch has owned Shamu since it paid $1.1 billion in
November to buy four Sea World parks, two additional theme parks
and adjacent land from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., but the
marketing rights were not part of the deal.
   Under the agreement, Watson General also will get royalties of
10 percent on the gross sales of Shamu merchandise sold outside the
theme parks and 50 percent of all the net proceeds from ``Shamu ...
The Beginning,'' a recently completed animated film included in the
sale.

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., the textbook publisher that fended off a 
hostile takeover bid in 1987 but tripled its debt in the process, said today 
that it will sell its theme parks and land holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the sale of six theme parks, including Sea World in San Diego, 
and others in Florida, Texas and Ohio, will allow it to substantially reduce 
its debt and boost investment in its publishing and insurance businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Harcourt also owns two other parks in central Florida -- Cypress Gardens, and 
Boardwalk and Baseball. The company's real estate holdings include land 
surrounding its three Florida parks and Sea World in Texas, as well as land 
next to Orlando International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An About-Face 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale represents an about-face for the company. Harcourt, which 
sold about $370 million in assets in the fourth quarter of 1987, including a 
magazine publishing business, previously said it planned no other asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst expressed surprise at the announcement for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought the theme parks were not strongly connected to the media 
business. However, they adamantly denied that they had any intention of selling 
them," said J. Kendrick Noble Jr. of PaineWebber Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Noble noted that the parks did not perform as well as expected in 1988, and he 
said that may have influenced the company's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The parks accounted for $338 million of Harcourt's $1.8 billion in revenues in 
1988, and showed an operating profit of $61.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut Expenses 
</P>
<P>
However, Harcourt dramatically cut expenses at the parks last year. In August, 
the company trimmed 700 jobs at its six parks.

<HEAD>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich to Sell Florida Marine Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A developer who is buying a marine
laboratory in the Florida Keys from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
says he plans to build a resort but also hopes to preserve the
research facility.
   Henk Mastenbroek, who has developed several time-share vacation
properties in the Keys, agreed to pay $700,000 for the 7{-acre Sea
World Marine Science and Conservation Center, the only operating
facility of its kind in the country. An official at the Florida
Institute of Oceanography said the marine laboratory was unique
because of its access to tropical waters.
   The lab is being sold by the book publishing company Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich Inc., which has been under pressure to sell real
estate and other assets to repay creditors after fending off a
hostile takeover bid last year. The marine lab was used to collect
sharks and tropical fish for HBJ's Sea World theme parks.
   The company had agreed to sell the laboratory to the Florida
Institute of Oceanography, an arm of the state university system,
but the deal fell through when the HBJ realized there was no
guarantee that the Legislature would allocate money for the
purchase, said Jim Harris, senior vice president of HBJ Land Co.
   Mastenbroek agreed to pay the same price the state would have
paid. He said although he planned to build a resort on the site, he
hoped he could maintain the lab, built in 1978, The Orlando
Sentinel reported in Saturday's editions.
   An administrator at the Institute of Oceanography said she
doubted that the marine laboratory would remain intact.
   ``Our problem is they (the developers) keep saying they have to
make money out of it, which isn't too likely,'' Sandra Vargo, a
project coordinator at the institute. ``I've seen too many research
facilities and they're not money makers.''
   Three years ago, the institute contracted with HBJ to use the
marine center for its own research. About 400 community college and
university students visit the center every year for a week-long
course on marine biology.
   Currently, the Department of Natural Resources is growing 10,000
conchs there to determine whether they can be grown to reseed
depleted conch beds. State and university researchers also are
studying the lobster population to determine whether the creature
has been overfished and needs protection.
   Vargo said the only other sites under U.S. control where similar
research could be conducted were in Puerto Rico and St. Croix.

<HEAD>Peter Jovanovich Named President of Publishing Giant Run By Father</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Jovanovich has been promoted to
president and chief executive officer at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc., making him second in command after his father, HBJ Chairman
William Jovanovich.
   The younger Jovanovich, 40, formerly served as executive vice
president of the Orlando-based publishing and insurance company. He
succeeds Ralph D. Caulo, 54, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31.
   Caulo has resigned to ``enter other ventures in central Florida
and in Austin and San Antonio, Texas,'' the company said Wednesday.
William Jovanovich, 69, remains as chairman of the board of HBJ.
   Caulo's position at the publishing gaint has appeared in
jeopardy since last summer, when HBJ announced plans to sell its
six theme parks. The company also said at the time that it would
allow Caulo to leave his post to manage the parks.
   But an HBJ executive close to sale negotiations told the Orlando
Sentinel that Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., which bought the parks in
November for $1.1 billion, wanted to employ its own park executive.
   William Jovanovich, the Sentinel reported in Thursday's
editions, sought to oust Caulo in order to place his son Peter in a
better position to later assume leadership of the company.
   Caulo could not be immediately reached for comment.
   In 1987, HBJ assumed nearly $3 billion in debt to fend off a
takeover bid by British press mogul Robert Maxwell. The sale last
month of its theme parks, including four Sea World parks, to
Anheuser-Busch was made to help pay off that debt.
   With the sale, HBJ reduced its debt by about $930 million to
about $1.63 billion, analysts say.
   Elizabeth Bramwell, an analyst at Gabelli &amp; Co., a New York
brokerage, said she believes Jovanovich's move to the HBJ
presidency ``is a constructive move'' that signals a determination
to turn the company's full attention to publishing, its core
business.
   ``They took their eye off the eight-ball and expense in
publishing and expenses this year got out of control,'' Bramwell
said.
   Ivan Obolensky, senior vice president at Josephthal &amp; Co.,
another New York brokerage, expressed doubt that the promotion of
Peter Jovanovich will make a big difference at HBJ. ``It's not a
big change; it's the leopard changing its spots.''
   Obolensky said he is concerned that HBJ remains vulnerable to a
hostile takeover.
   In his new position, Peter Jovanovich will supervise HBJ's
elementary and secondary school publishing. For the past five years
he has managed HBJ's other publishing businesses, including
university, medical, scientific and trade books, and fiction and
non-fiction titles.
   The younger Jovanovich joined HBJ in 1980 after working for
Macmillian Inc., another publishing house.

   A skeleton of what will be the world's
tallest wooden roller coaster already rises above the trees at Six
Flags Over Texas, and planners are concocting other gut-wrenching
thrills.
   Walt Disney Co. has splurged on a fantasyland of Hollywood
diversions and acquired rights to many of the Muppets, who will
cavort with Mickey and Goofy at Disney theme parks.
   Bidders seeking Sea World may pay more than $1 billion for Shamu,
the killer whale, and other finned celebrities.
   All this maneuvering reflects one common handicap in the $4
billion amusement-park business: Mother Nature still calls most of
the shots in a relatively short season that winds down after Labor
Day. So, the search for new diversions never ends.
   This summer, rain and heat kept many fun parks waiting for the
crowds, although others reported a late surge to surpass year-ago
levels.
   Especially hard hit were the 200 or so water parks, a fairly new
entrant into the amusement game.
   ``Our June was just horrendous,'' said John Seeker, spokesman for
Wet 'N Wild, a water park across the freeway from Six Flags in
Arlington. ``It's almost like summer never came.''
   Others had a better time of it.
   ``We had one weekend in August, which is traditionally one of our
biggest months, where we almost didn't even open. But despite all
that we're well ahead of last year,'' said Ed Carroll, general
manager at Riverside Park in Agawam, Mass., which added six new
water rides this year.
   Crystal Beach was not so lucky. The 101-year-old park in Fort
Erie, Ontario, Canada, just across the bridge from Buffalo, N.Y.,
said it will close down its rides after this season, reflecting
increased competition and dwindling crowds.
   ``This year we just took a nose dive,'' said President Joseph
Biondolillo. ``A lot of it was due to the rainy spring. Then we
started to lose numbers during the good weather.''
   Last year, the nation's 600 amusement parks reported more than
249 million visitors and operators surveyed in July said they
expected about a 2 percent increase this year, taking the early
season weather problems into account.
   But prices may also be holding back attendance.
   Admission to 27-year-old Six Flags Over Texas is $19.95, on the
high end of prices among regional parks.
   ``It's a little steep, especially when all four of us come,''
said Jackie Corley, who was visiting the park on a recent,
100-degree day.
   ``We'd think twice'' about coming back if the price were
increased, she said.
   Even next year's scheduled debut of the $5 million Texas Giant, a
4,920-foot long wooden roller coaster, might not be enough to
overcome the price, she said.
   Daughter Elisa, however, had a different view. She likes the park
``because I can have fun.''
   Roller coasters are a big draw at the larger parks, and are
frequently the main attractions.
   Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, for example, has a much-ballyhooed
new coaster this year _ the $3 million Timberwolf, and attendance is
up 10 percent, park officials said.
   The coaster recently was rated No. 2 in the nation in a survey by
Inside Track, a publication for roller coaster enthusiasts.
   ``We just had to come to see it,'' said Sara Johnson of Topeka,
Kan., at Worlds of Fun on a recent weekend with family members.
   She and family said the park was expensive, but they regarded it
as a special, once-a-summer outing and were willing to pay.
   In Houston, at Six Flags-owned Astroworld, The Viper coaster also
helped the park overcome early season doldrums brought on by
Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Chantal.
   There will be a new ride at Astroworld next year as well, but
spokeswoman Debra Ford wouldn't reveal the nature of the attraction,
except to say, ``it's going to be a great thrill ride.''
   The newest generation of thrills involves motion simulation _
rides that give passengers the feel of hurtling through space, or
under water, or flying an airplane. They can cost from $120,000 to
$2 million each, depending on the sophistication.
   The smaller scale of the motion simulators _ they don't require
towering support structures _ reflect a trend toward downsizing and
regionalization.
   ``We're close to saturation. There's no major metropolitan area
in the United States that doesn't have a park within easy driving
distance,'' said Peter Irish, an official with the International
Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, an industry group in
Alexandria, Va.
   As a result, IAAPA trade shows include seminars on miniature
golf, go-cart tracks, batting cages and arcades, Irish said.
   Parks also are turning to concerts and other entertainment to
draw people during slack times. An IAAPA survey this summer showed
more than 30 percent of the projects planned for the largest parks
were for entertainment.
   The parks are hoping to attract more customers like Paul and
Paula Jarvis of Bowie, Md., who visited Williamsburg, Va.'s Busch
Gardens along with their grandchildren.
   ``We like the shows,'' Mrs. Jarvis said. ``We really don't go for
the rides too much.''
   Regional does not mean less lucrative. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc. is selling off its parks _ four Sea Worlds, plus other smaller
parks near its Orlando headquarters _ and it is estimated the deal
could bring the publisher $1.5 billion, 23 times what HBJ paid for
the three Sea Worlds it bought in 1976.
   Bigger is still better as far as players like Disney are
concerned, however.
   With this year's addition of the new Disney-MGM Studios theme
park in Florida and the announced purchase of rights to the Muppet
characters this past week, Disney's pursuit of new attractions has
reached Barnum-esque proportions.
   The Disney-MGM theme park is a $400 million playground with
diversions that range from do-it-yourself music videos to
recreations of 1940s Hollywood Boulevard.
   ``The public response to the new Disney-MGM Studios theme park
has been overwhelming, beyond our wildest dreams. It has led to our
decision to expand the park, doubling it in size in the next two
years,'' spokesman John Dreyer said.
   The company refuses to disclose attendance figures, but one
analyst estimates as many as 150,000 a day pass through the Disney
gates in Florida, paying $100 for a four-day ticket.
   Its size and variety make a Disney a ``destination park'' in the
lingo of the amusement business. It also profits from nearby
attractions that have sprung up in its shadow and feed off its
success. The Orlando area is home to Sea World, Boardwalk and
Baseball, Cypress Gardens and Busch Gardens nearby in Tampa. In
addition, MCA Inc. is investing $600 million in a Universal Studio
park near Orlando to compete with Disney.

<HEAD>Publisher Denies Plans to File For Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rumors on Wall Street that heavily indebted
publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. would file for bankruptcy
sent HBJ stock plummeting Thursday and prompted a rare company
denial.
   HBJ ``is not a candidate for Chapter 11'' bankruptcy protection,
William Jovanovich, the company's reclusive chairman, said in a
statement released after the market closed.
   Jovanovich made his statement to the Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report, a New York news service, after the Orlando-based
company sought to calm market jitters with another statement early
in the afternoon.
   The bankruptcy rumors, Jovanovich said, came in response to the
publicized problems of other indebted companies, an apparent
reference to bankruptcy filings Monday by Campeau Corp.'s Allied
Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Huge sales of HBJ stock early in the day fueled speculation
surrounding the publisher.
   HBJ stock, which traded at nearly $10 a share just three months
ago, traded as low as $2 before finishing 12{ cents down at $2.875,
a record low.
   Volume totalled 4.8 million shares, making it the most active
issue on the New York Stock Exchange.
   After the stock hit its low point, the company issued its first
statement saying that operating income and cash flow in 1990 would
be ``significantly higher'' than what HBJ will post for 1989.
   HBJ is not due to release 1989 earnings until February or March.
In 1988, the company posted a loss of $126.5 million because of
high interest payments associated with its debt.
   On Monday, Allied and Federated filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, largely because of
billions of dollars of debt stemming from the acquisition of the
companies by Canada's Campeau Corp. in recent years.
   HBJ has about $1.6 billion of junk bonds outstanding. The
company borrowed nearly $3 billion as part of a frantic
recapitalization 2{ years ago to repell a hostile takeover bid by
British publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Last year, HBJ sold its six theme parks to Anheuser-Busch Cos.
Inc. for $1.1 billion in an effort to pare its debt. The
attractions included the Sea World parks in Orlando; San Antonio,
Texas; San Diego; and Aurora, Ohio; Boardwalk and Baseball near
Haines City and Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven.
   Ivan Obolensky, an analyst who follows HBJ for the Josephthal &amp;
Co. brokerage, told the Sentinel he didn't believe the publisher
was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy.
   Neither did Douglas Evan Schimmel, a New York money manager.
   ``Things would have to get a lot worse for the company to file
bankruptcy,'' Schimmel said.

When Bob Lavenberg called Sea World last month to say that a live megamouth 
shark had been captured off Dana Point -- only the second such known occurrence 
ever -- he thought he was making the San Diego theme park an offer it could not 
refuse: the opportunity to house and study a species so rare that, until 1976, 
scientists were not aware it existed. 
</P>
<P>
Lavenberg, curator of fishes at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural 
History, was surprised when Sea World officials declined. They told Lavenberg 
they lacked the expertise and facilities to ensure the 15-foot megamouth's 
survival. But as well as worrying about the shark's health, Sea World officials 
seemed to fear for the park's image. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'One of the things we don't want to do is take this animal and have 
it die on us,' " Lavenberg said. "No. 1 was they did not have the facilities to 
take it, and No. 2 was there was a potential that it would die. They were very 
sensitive about this. . . . They did not want to have it die on their hands." 
</P>
<P>
In light of the park's recent history, such sensitivity is not surprising. In 2 
1/2 years, six whales have died at the San Diego park -- including three killer 
whales, the park's most popular attraction. Officials maintain that except for 
Kandu, a killer whale that died after an accident during a performance, all 
died of old age or diseases that could have stricken them in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
The string of fatalities has cast a shadow over the private amusement park. Sea 
World officials acknowledge that the losses have taken a toll on staff morale. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we would ever step back away from helping animals just because 
we were concerned that somebody was going to start taking (shots) at us," said 
Brad Andrews, a Sea World vice president and assistant zoological director 
based in Florida. How decisions are made about housing animals "boils down to 
what's best for the animal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one likes to accentuate the negative," said Bob Gault, president of Sea 
World of California, who added that people come to the park "to escape the 
day-to-day hassles of life," not to confront them. Gault asserts that, 
especially since they were bought by Anheuser-Busch from Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich in 1989, the four parks have dealt more frankly with the passing of 
their animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not like Disney, where a ride breaks down and they can just go plug in 
another one," Gault said. "In life there is birth and there is death, and at 
Sea World we experience both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, questions have arisen about how deaths may affect future births -- 
specifically the captive breeding of killer whales. This September, Kanduke, 
one of the chain's two remaining male killer whales, died unexpectedly at the 
Florida park. Since then, Sea World veterinarians have been shuffling breeding 
plans to manage what some experts say is a poor gender ratio. 
</P>
<P>
Without federal permits to capture killer whales in the wild, the four parks -- 
in San Diego; San Antonio, Tex.; Aurora, Ohio, and Orlando, Fla. -- depend 
largely on newborns to stock their exhibits and shows. But, among them, the 
four parks have 12 females and just one male: Kotar, an orca at the Texas park. 
</P>
<P>
"That's certainly not optimal," said Tom Laughlin, a marine biologist with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service in Seattle. "Biologically, one wants to have 
heterozygosity in the gene pool -- more than one male contributing. The more 
vibrant the strain -- the more diverse -- the more resistant offspring is to 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
The necessity of breeding healthy young is heightened by Sea World's economic 
dependence on killer whales. As well as being the star attraction in the San 
Diego park's "Baby Shamu Celebration" show, killer whales are the centerpiece 
of the park's marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World visitors are invited to shop for Shamu-embossed gifts, from sweat 
shirts to jewelry, and to pose for $4 framed snapshots with a stuffed orca at 
the Shamu Photo Stand. The name "Shamu," which is used for whichever whale is 
performing in the 5-million-gallon Shamu Stadium, is a registered trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"They're one of the key elements in the draw," said Harrison Price, a 
consultant in attraction management and development and a former Sea World 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
A National Marine Fisheries Service inventory of Sea World's marine mammals, 
living and dead, shows that over the San Diego park's nearly 30 years of 
operation, scores of animals have died largely unnoticed by the public. When an 
animal has a public identity, its passing attracts attention. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, Orky sank to the bottom of his pool and died just three 
days after the birth of a calf he fathered -- Orkid, commonly known as Baby 
Shamu. Estimated to be 27 to 32 years old, Orky was the oldest killer whale in 
captivity at the time, and a necropsy conducted by Sea World showed he had died 
of acute pneumonia brought on by old age. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months later, a 15-year-old beluga whale named Little Girl died of 
cardiopulmonary collapse. On loan from the Minnesota Zoo, Little Girl had come 
to San Diego to accompany Big Mouth, a sick male beluga receiving treatment for 
an inflammatory bone disease. Big Mouth died the next summer, as did an ailing 
false killer whale named Asia. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Kandu's death that shocked most people. In August, 1989, during a 
performance, the 4,600-pound mother of Orkid charged into another whale, Corky, 
and broke her jaw. The impact caused hemorrhaging of major arteries in the 
14-year-old whale's nasal passages and Kandu bled to death. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of that fatality -- called a freak accident by Sea World officials -- 
were still fresh when Knootka, a killer whale in her mid- to late-20s, died of 
a rare fungal infection last March. Knootka's was the first death at the San 
Diego park since Anheuser-Busch had taken the helm, and officials were 
noticeably more open about the whale's illness and death. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to be up-front about it," said Dan LeBlanc, who handles media 
inquiries at the San Diego park. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said the recent deaths have prompted changes in breeding schedules -- 
some of which reach 15 years into the future. The lone male, Kotar, is not 
related to any of the 12 females, he said, so there is probably no genetic 
reason why he cannot mate with them all. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said the program -- which has produced five healthy captive-born babies 
in as many years -- is self-sufficient. Recent blood samples taken from Keneau 
in Texas and Kasatka in San Diego indicate a high likelihood that both are 
pregnant by Kotar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the park's new openness will affect public opinion is unclear. Sea 
World's attendance, like that of most Southern California amusement parks, is 
down this year from last year -- a downturn that Price, the consultant, 
attributes to a decrease in long-distance tourism. During the first eight 
months of 1989, nearly 3 million people visited the park -- about 200,000 more 
than the same period this year. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the Southwest Fishery Science Center in La Jolla found that the 
probability of a whale surviving one year in a U.S. park is roughly the same as 
in the wild -- 90% to 95%.

DOLPHIN GROUP URGES BOYCOTT OF SEA WORLD 
</P>

<P>
A Miami-based environmental group on Monday called for a boycott of all Sea 
World parks and all products produced by Anheuser-Busch because the company has 
refused to rid its five marine theme parks of "petting pool conditions" that 
the group says endanger dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
The call for the boycott was made by the Dolphin Project, which was joined by 
three other animal protection groups, all of which allege that the giant beer 
company's parks regularly violate government restrictions by overcrowding 
dolphins in the pools and by putting too much chlorine in the water. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at a Beverly Hills hotel, Scott Trimingham, 
president of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a group participating in 
the boycott, claimed that dolphins in cramped tanks constantly injure 
themselves as they butt up against each other, and that inordinately high 
chlorine levels have been causing the animals to go blind. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World executives contested the allegations, saying the pools meet 
government standards. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World parks' assistant zoological director, Brad Andrews, speaking at 
another news conference at the hotel, called the allegations false and said the 
activists are not qualified to comment on whether the dolphins' living 
conditions are unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"The claims appear to be fabrications," Andrews said. "In the industry, the 
people making these comments are nonentities. . . . We would not allow anything 
abnormal to happen to the dolphins. The pools are adequate." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews cited a U.S. Department of Agriculture letter addressed to Trimingham, 
who requested an investigation into the alleged suffering of dolphins being 
kept in petting tanks. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, USDA officials said a pool at Sea World in San Diego complies 
with the agency's space stipulations. Still, Trimingham claimed that a pool at 
Sea World in Orlando, Fla., has failed to meet regulations. USDA officials also 
said the chlorine level in the two pools was acceptable by their standard. 
</P>
<P>
Even when government regulations are met, Trimingham contended, there is no 
guarantee the animals are being protected. 
</P>
<P>
He referred to USDA officials who formulate safety guidelines as "prostitute 
scientists" -- those working for, or associated with, the marine park industry. 
</P>
<P>
"By visiting Sea World, children have the opportunity to become acquainted with 
marine mammals and other ocean life, which is important in developing an 
awareness and concern for the future of these animals," said Michael J. Roarty, 
a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch Companies in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"The educational benefits of the interactive pools -- indeed all Sea Worlds' 
operations -- are important. . . . Sea World regularly receives letters from 
children saying that one of the things that they appreciate most about a visit 
to the parks is the chance to reach out and feed or touch a dolphin." 
</P>
<P>
One of the strongest voices calling for the removal of the petting tanks has 
been Richard O'Barry, the trainer of dolphins that appeared in the 1960s 
television series "Flipper." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Flipper' was one of the best and worst things that has happened to 
dolphins," he said. The five dolphins O'Barry trained for the series helped to 
"create an awareness about dolphins and the ocean," he said, but they also 
"created an unnatural desire to hold and caress them." 
</P>
<P>
When several of the dolphins he trained died due to "captivity stress," he 
began lobbying against those who continued to train the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"For 10 years, I was part of the problem," O'Barry said. "Now I'm on the other 
side of the fence." 
</P>
<P>
O'Barry said the boycott was raised after a yearlong call for the end of the 
petting pools. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now going after Anheuser-Busch in a way that they must take heed, 
through their consumers." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Anheuser-Busch marine parks have been reluctant to discontinue use 
of the petting pools, because of their appeal to an estimated 12.5 million 
visitors per year. Sea World officials acknowledged that the dolphin exhibits 
are among the parks' most popular. 
</P>
<P>
The brewing-industry giant bought Sea World in December, 1989, from Harcourt 
Brace Jovanovich for $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott is aimed at the company's 17 different beer products, as well as 
its Eagle brand snack foods. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Sea World parks in San Diego and Orlando, Anheuser-Busch 
owns Sea Worlds in San Antonio, Tex., and Akron, Ohio. Dolphin Project 
representatives said the boycott also extends to Anheuser-Busch's other theme 
park in Tampa.

KILLER WHALE BLED TO DEATH AFTER BREAKING JAW IN FIGHT

Kandu the killer whale died from massive bleeding caused by a freak injury 
when, showing "normal behavior," she attacked a larger female whale that she 
was attempting to dominate, Sea World officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World veterinarian Jim McBain said Kandu, who weighed about 4,600 pounds, 
attacked Corky, her 7,000-pound rival, during the 4 p.m. show at the park 
Monday. McBain said trainers saw the whales fight in a holding pen behind the 
main pool midway into the 25-minute show. 
</P>
<P>
The trainers reported seeing Kandu charge into Corky with her mouth open. The 
impact fractured Kandu's upper jaw, causing fatal hemorrhaging of major 
arteries in the whale's nasal passages, McBain said. The veterinarian said 
there was nothing park officials could do to save Kandu. 
</P>
<P>
As thousands of spectators watched, Kandu spouted blood that stained the water 
and the sides of the tank. 
</P>
<P>
"The altercation was initiated by Kandu. She was asserting her dominance by 
going after Corky with her mouth open," McBain said. "It's common behavior. For 
the survival of any species, the stronger animal has to rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The death was an unexpected shock, but the altercation was not a rare event at 
all. It was normal behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World officials said Kandu had repeatedly exerted her dominance since Corky 
was brought to the park from Marineland three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
While Sea World officials characterized the whale death as an accident 
resulting from normal whale behavior, critics took the opportunity to reopen 
the debate over whether these mammals should be kept in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Sea World officials briefly considered canceling the park's 
trademark whale shows. But McBain said the suggestion was rejected when 
trainers argued that it would be better for the remaining three whales "if we 
continued with a normal day." The shows continued Tuesday morning, but there 
were no trainers in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Many park visitors interviewed Tuesday in the killer whale stadium said they 
were unaware of Kandu's death. Park officials said they are currently in their 
peak season and attendance was normal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to McBain, the fatal collision between the two whales only took about 
five seconds, but Kandu lingered for about 45 minutes before she died. The orca 
made news last September when she gave birth to Baby Shamu during a 
performance. The birth was videotaped, and the marine park has been using it in 
its advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Baby Shamu was still nursing, Sea World officials said 
they were confident that Kandu's death will not have an adverse effect on the 
young whale. McBain said Baby Shamu is eating about 40 to 45 pounds of solid 
food a day and is staying with Corky at night. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, she (Baby Shamu) realizes that something is different. She appears 
to be awaiting her mother, but we think she'll do all right at the end," McBain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Corky, who is believed to be in her mid to late 20s, suffered superficial cuts 
but was otherwise unhurt in the incident, McBain said. Kandu was believed to be 
14 years old and had given birth in 1986 to a baby that was stillborn. 
</P>
<P>
Killer whales' social structure is dominated by females, and the only males 
allowed in a pod are transient breeders and babies. McBain said it was natural 
for a younger female like Kandu to assert her dominance over an older one like 
Corky. 
</P>
<P>
McBain said that at first, it was not apparent to the trainers that Kandu had 
been injured in the brief confrontation with Corky. No trainers were in the 
water when the fight occurred, Sea World officials said. About two minutes 
after the two made contact, both mammals briefly chased each other in the main 
pool but did not touch again, McBain added. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, trainers and thousands of horrified spectators in Shamu Stadium 
saw blood streaming from Kandu's blowhole. While one trainer directed Kandu and 
Baby Shamu back to the holding pen, another stayed with Corky, McBain said. 
</P>
<P>
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, owners of the four Sea Worlds and two other theme 
parks, are currently looking for a buyer to take over the attractions. Analysts 
and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich officials downplayed the financial impact of the 
whale's death and its possible effects on the sale of the parks. 
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Sea World has 16 other whales, including five calves born 
in captivity over the last two years. Kandu, who was valued at about $1 
million, was not insured. 
</P>
<P>
A necropsy was done on Kandu Monday night. McBain said veterinarians found 
nothing unusual with Kandu's internal organs. 
</P>
<P>
Kandu's death was the second whale fatality at Sea World in less than a year. 
Orky, a male whale who accompanied Corky when Sea World bought Marineland, died 
last September, three days after Kandu gave birth to Baby Shamu. Orky sired 
Baby Shamu. A necropsy revealed that Orky, who was about 30 and the oldest 
killer whale in captivity at the time, died from natural causes.

report.

<TEXT>
   Before getting to the meat of this story, the aim of which is to tell how and why the Kansas City Royals came to be conducting their spring training in an amusement park, I feel that a word of explanation about the above dateline is in order. 

   There is, in fact, no such city as "Baseball City, Fla.," but the alternatives to using it struck me as less palatable than this mild deception. 

   The tract of land in question sits at the intersection of Interstate Highway 4 and U.S. Highway 27 in unincorporated Polk County, midway between Lakeland and Orlando in the central part of the state, but that description is so bulky as to be off-putting. 
The name of the amusement park is Boardwalk and Baseball, but that would be overly commercial and no more informative since it, too, is on no maps. 

   Some newspapers, in an attempt to avoid the wordiness/commercial dilemma, are using the dateline of Haines City, the nearest legal burg. 
But that's 10 miles to the south, and using it misleads and inconveniences anyone driving there expecting to see a ball game. 

   "It's also a problem for us," admits Dick Howard, Boardwalk and Baseball's president. 
"We got the county to declare us 'Baseball City' because it's catchy, but people say they have to ask all sorts of directions to get here. 
We just hope the problem goes away as they get used to coming." 

   They'll also have to get used to hearing the screams of the folks riding the roller coaster a few yards from the spiffy new ballpark B&amp;B built for the Royals. 
We Americans are adaptable, so chances are that we will. 
At any rate, whether you believe baseball and roller coasters go together like apple pie and ice cream, or like apple pie and sauerkraut, the combination is here to stay for the term of the Royals' 15-year lease. 

   The Royals moved to Baseball City this spring from Fort Myers, Fla., for the same reason that four other Major League teams (the Texas Rangers, Houston Astros, Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets) have shifted their spring bases in the past two seasons: They received an offer they couldn't refuse. 
And in each case, the offer was pretty much the same: A state-of-the-art training and exhibition-game facility in return for little more than the exertion required to sign on the dotted line. 

   The number of teams making similar moves seems sure to rise as more Florida communities, including some that actually appear on the map, mount bids to snatch a slice of the spring-training grapefruit, worth between $10 million and $15 million each spring per team in sales of food, booze, gas, lodgings and suntan oil to baseball-starved Northerners. 
Among the clubs currently being wooed are the Minnesota Twins, New York Yankees and Chicago Cubs. 
If an old-timer napping in his $2 grandstand seat once symbolized the activity, $7 box seats and ticket-scalpers do now. 

   The Rangers (Port Charlotte), Reds (Plant City) and Astros (Kissimmee) all moved to facilities built and paid for by Florida cities or counties eager to entice tourists. 
The Mets are the come-on for a planned residential development that aims to triple the population of Port St. Lucie, a town of 15,000 between Fort Pierce and Vero Beach on the state's east coast. 

   All received a stadium, major- and minor-league clubhouses, indoor-batting and pitching areas and a four-field cloverleaf of practice diamonds that a manager can oversee from an observation tower, a la Bear Bryant. 
They pay little or no rent, and get to keep a goodly share of ticket and concession revenues. 
"It's the best deal in town. 
You can't beat it with a stick," observes Tom Kindred, assistant administrator of St. Lucie County, which manages the Mets' facility for the firm that built it. 

   The Royals' deal with Boardwalk and Baseball is about the same, the main difference being that the landlord is an amusement park. 
The link was the corporate brainchild of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., which also owns the Sea World and Cypress Gardens parks. 
It bought the former Circus World park here in 1986 and spent a year and $24 million installing a baseball motif. 
About $13 million of that sum went into the Royals' complex. 

   When the big-leaguers aren't in residence, baseball will be supplied by the Royals' Class A minor-league team the company also purchased, and by games between local high schools, colleges and kids-league contestants. 
Contests matching two "house" teams manned by local aces filled open dates last winter, but they might not be needed this year. 

   B&amp;B's Mr. Howard avoids calling his a "theme" park. 
"We're a traditional amusement park with a baseball dimension -- two entities in one," he asserts. 
"They're compatible, but you can enjoy one without the other." 
The distinction mirrors the park's ticket policy for spring training and minor-league games, which enables customers to attend the games and park separately or together in complex price combinations. 
He notes, though, that at other times "baseball is thrown in free, like the whale show at Sea World." 

   Having his sport classed with Shamu doesn't bother Royals' general manager John Schuerholz. 
He is too busy being "ecstatic" about the facility. 
"We couldn't ask for more because they did everything we asked," Schuerholz says. 
"B&amp;B came to us and said, 'Design yourself a baseball complex.' 
We did." 

   All the practice fields have the same dimensions as the team's Royals Stadium home, and the 7,000-seat main field has the same brand of artificial-turf infield. 
Schuerholz's enclosed box here views the playing field from the same angle as his seat in KC. 

   Oh, there have been a few problems, like having to dial 11 numbers to phone the minor-league players' hotel across the street from the team's office, and the steel-tube roof support that flapped loose on a windy day last week while the Royals were playing Toronto. 
But nothing's perfect. 
"I've even gotten used to the roller coaster," says Schuerholz. 
"It's better than some other ballpark sounds I've heard."

   Confining killer whales in tanks to perform
generates jobs, good times for the public and money for Sea World,
but the practice is being questioned since a fight between two of
the mammals ended in death.
   Some biologists say that killer whales in the open ocean don't
fight and that putting them in tanks makes them neurotic and
aggressive toward each other.
   Sea World denies captivity played a role in the deadly Aug. 21
fight between two female whales. The National Marine Fisheries
Service, which regulates display of marine mammals, agreed with Sea
World that the death was an accident.
   Killer whales, also called orcas, are a prime attraction at San
Diego's Sea World and three sister Sea Worlds, so the acts are
important to the economic well-being of the parks and 4,800
year-round employees.
   As part of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s parks division, the
four Sea Worlds, with two other amusement parks, last year generated
$61.8 million in income on $338 million in revenue. No income
breakdowns for individual parks are available. HBJ's parks division
is on the market for a reported $1.3 billion.
   Sea World officials defend the park as more than a money-making
enterprise.
   Youngsters often ``come away with knowledge they didn't have
before and a fascination that doesn't go away,'' Sea World
veterinarian Jim McBain said. ``They become advocates for the marine
environment.''
   Nonetheless, captivity could have been a key factor in Kandu's
death, said Ken Balcomb, a research biologist at the Center for
Whale Research in Friday Harbor, Wash.
   ``I'm pretty sure virtually all animals in captivity develop
neuroses,'' he said. ``You do have a stress factor. It's pretty much
a caged mentality they have to live with.''
   The park's 11-month-old Baby Shamu was orphaned when her mother,
Kandu, collided with a performing partner, Corky, in a
5-million-gallon pool.
   The 3-ton Kandu's upper jaw was fractured and she bled to death
before thousands of spectators. It was the first killer whale to die
in a fight in the park's 25-year history.
   Corky, weighing 8,000 pounds, is believed to be about 25 years
old.
   About 30 members of the group Friends of Whales picketed Sea
World on Saturday, protesting the confinement of killer whales. One
protester held up a sign reading, ``Is it `fun' to see animals die
in captivity?' ''
   Sea World officials have said that most of the public reaction
since Kandu's death has been sympathetic and favorable.
   McBain said 14-year-old Kandu's actions were normal for killer
whales, which are not known to have ever killed humans but are
skillful, efficient hunters. They eat mostly fish or seals but also
attack other whale species.
   McBain said they butt, chase and nip each other while
establishing and maintaining social hierarchies.
   But Balcomb, who has monitored orcas off San Juan Island, Wash.,
for 13 years, said such whale rivalries are nonexistent at sea.
   ``In the wild, they don't solve their problems aggressively,''
Balcomb said. ``It's not normal. Killer whales travel in kinship
groups or clans and they don't have those aggressive interactions.
If other whales come along from a different group, they just avoid
each other. Obviously, you can't do that in a tank.''
   McBain acknowledged that past pools were too small and probably
contributed to earlier failed breeding efforts and premature deaths
of killer whales, first captured for display in the mid-1960s. Shamu
Stadium in San Diego, built in 1987, more than quadrupled the killer
whales' quarters.
   Also in 1987, trainers were pulled from the water for several
months after a series of accidents in which whales injured trainers.
Trainers were allowed to return to the water last year under
stricter safety guidelines.
   Just how long killer whales live at sea and how that compares to
captive orcas remain an area of debate. Some biologists believe a
female whale lives up to 80 years in the wild while the maximum for
a male is about 50.
   In captivity, killer whales on average have died within eight
years, primarily because of infection, according to Balcomb.
   But McBain said Corky remains in good condition after 21 years of
captivity.
   Corky and Baby Shamu are among three whales remaining at the San
Diego park. Twelve others are at Sea Worlds in San Antonio, Texas;
Aurora, Ohio, and Orlando, Fla. Four other calves have been born in
captivity over the past four years, Sea World spokesman Dan LeBlanc
said.

   Investors in Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. still appear worried about the publishing giant's long-term prospects, despite the $1.1 billion the company will receive from the sale of its six theme parks. 

   The company's stock plunged $4.125 a share Friday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $12.125. 
The sell-off came 24 hours after the company announced it would sell its Sea World and other theme parks to Anheuser Busch Cos. 

   The $1.1 billion price tag was "disappointing," according to one institutional investor. 
In June, when Harcourt disclosed its plan to sell the parks, many analysts suggested the assets would bring at least $1.5 billion. 

   The lower-than-expected sale price, analysts said, likely will force Harcourt to sell other assets, particularly its insurance business, to further reduce its debt load. 

   Harcourt "bought time" with the theme-park sale, said Bert Boksen, an analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
But "I think they'll ultimately have to sell the insurance company." 

   In an interview after the sale announcement Thursday, John Berardi, senior vice president and treasurer of Harcourt, said the company's insurance business is profitable and that Harcourt has no plans to sell it. 

   Harcourt said Thursday that it would use $930 million of initial net proceeds from the theme-park sale to reduce its $1.12 billion in long-term bank debt. 
But the company still owes about $1.6 billion of junk-bond debt, which carries an interest rate of about 14%. 
The heavy debt load stems from 1987, when Harcourt fended off a hostile takeover bid by British publisher Robert Maxwell. 
William Jovanovich, Harcourt's chairman, engineered a $2.9 billion recapitalization by borrowing more than $2 billion. 

   Harcourt officials didn't return phone calls Friday. 
But a person close to the company said Harcourt is "comfortable" with the high-yield debt. 
The company, he said, has good cash flow from its publishing and insurance operations. 

   For Anheuser-Busch, the theme-park pact carries a risk to its credit ratings. 
Moody's Investors Service said Friday that it is considering whether to downgrade about $1.76 billion of the brewer's long-term debt. 
Anheuser-Busch's purchase of the six parks would increase its debt and interest expense, the rating agency said. 

   The ratings under review include the double-A-3 rating on Anheuser-Busch's Eurobonds, Euromarket notes, sinking-fund debentures, New Zealand dollar notes, medium-term notes and industrial development revenue bonds.

   Debt-burden Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
reported Thursday a smaller loss in the first quarter than a year
ago as its revenue rose 14.6 percent.
   The report of the latest loss comes a day after the publishing
and insurance concern, which sold its theme park holdings last
year, said it was discussing the possible sale of additional assets.
   For the three-month period ending March 31, Harcourt reported it
lost $78.3 million, or $1.07 per share, compared with a loss of
$131.5 million, or $1.80 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose to $276.9 million from $241.6 million in 1989.
   Harcourt's insurance division posted first-quarter income from
operations of $11.1 million, down from $12.5 million a year earlier.
   But the company's publishing division had a loss from operations
of $28.7 million, compared with a loss from operations of $46.1
million a year earlier.
   Its overall loss from continuing operations fell to $20.2
million compared with a loss from contining operations of $39.2
million a year earlier.
   The company has been struggling under a $2 billion debt incurred
in May 1987 when it underwent a recapitalization to avert a
takeover by British publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Peter Jovanovich, president and chief executive officer, said
late Wednesday that the company has begun preliminary discussions
involving the sale of some or all of its existing debt at a
discount, or the purchase of ``certain assets of the company by a
third party.''
   ``HBJ is not for sale,'' Jovanovich said in a statement. ``It is
simply premature to speculate as to whether a transaction will
occur, and, if one does occur, as to its eventual form or terms.''
   The statement followed a report earlier Wednesday that former
U.S. Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who has served for a decade on HBJ's
board, said discussions had been under way with Tomson Corp. of
Canada for a month.
   Harcourt sold its four Sea World parks and two other theme parks
to Anheuser-Busch Cos. for $1.1 billio last September.
   Analysts said Harcourt needed to sell the parks to help pay off
a its debt.

   ST. LOUIS -- Anheuser-Busch Cos.' Busch Entertainment
Corp. unit, responding to declining attendance, said it is
cutting staff and eliminating some of the attractions at its
Cypress Gardens park.
   The plan includes eliminating 80 of the Winter Haven,
Fla., park's current 403 full-time staff; also, 36 currently
unfilled positions will remain vacant.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As part of the "repositioning," Anheuser-Busch said,
"marginally popular attractions are to be eliminated so that
increased emphasis can be placed on the park's botanical and
water-ski heritage." All zoological exhibits and animal shows
and two live entertainment acts will be cut.
   The cutbacks "are in response to declining atendance over
a period of time in which the park's staffing level has not
been adjusted to reflect attendance patterns," Anheuser-Busch
said. It noted that attendance at Cypress Gardens has slipped
from about 1.4 million visitors in 1987 to "under 900,000 in
1990."
   The theme park industry has recently slumped nationwide,
as the slowed economy has caused consumers to trim
discretionary spending.
   Anheuser-Busch said it thinks attendance at Cypress
Gardens "has now stabilized."
   Anheuser-Busch acquired Cypress Gardens, along with the
Sea World parks, in 1989, as part of its $1.1 billion
acquisition of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s theme park
operations.

Harcourt Brace to Cut Interest Expense: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich said it will 
reduce its annual cash interest expense by $115 million as a result of the sale 
of its theme parks and land. The Orlando, Fla.-based company said cash flow 
from its publishing and insurance businesses will be "entirely sufficient" to 
pay its cash interest obligations for the foreseeable future. Harcourt Brace's 
sale last week to Anheuser-Busch Cos. included its four Sea World theme parks 
as well as 1,200 acres of undeveloped land.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. sold its Marineland sea park after taking steps to save the whales -- and Harcourt's corporate reputation. 

   The textbook publisher said James G. Monaghan, a real estate developer based in Phoenix, Ariz., bought the park and its prime ocean-front acreage in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   In conjunction with the sale, Harcourt said it will put up $750,000 to build a facility for the care of sick and stranded whales and other sea animals. 
It also said it set up a Foundation for Marine Animal Husbandry, which will be financed by a $2.3 million grant from Harcourt. 
That largesse is partly an effort to repair Harcourt's image with sea-life lovers in California. 

   Harcourt, which owns another park, Sea World, in San Diego, bought Marineland for $23.4 million in late 1986, promising to renovate it. 
Instead, it closed Marineland in March and put the acreage up for sale. 
Local residents charged that Harcourt bought Marineland only so it could net popular attractions such as killer whales Orky and Corky for Sea World. 
People called the company greedy, and said it didn't care about such high-minded Marineland operations as its nonprofit ward for sick whales and sea lions. 

   "That was a bum rap," said Peter Jovanovich, an executive vice president. 
He said the new animal care facility will mean that Harcourt will be footing the bill for about 1,000 troubled sea beasts a year. 
"That's a lot for a book publisher," he said.

<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. on Wednesday
reported a 4 percent drop in third-quarter profits despite a more
than $80 million rise in sales at the publishing-entertainment
conglomerate.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, the Orlando-based company
earned $60.4 million, or $1 a share, on sales of $625.6 million,
compared with earnings of $63.2 million, or $1.21 a share, on sales
of $543.1 million in the same period last year.
   HBJ, the nation's largest textbook publisher, also owns
insurance operations and theme parks, including Sea Worlds in
Orlando, San Diego, San Antonio, Texas and Aurora, Ohio.
   Some of the decline in earnings is linked to restructuring costs
to thwart a hostile takeover bid by Maxwell Communication Corp.
   Since mid-August, HBJ has laid off 10 percent of its parks
division staff, replaced or relocated a number of executives and
canceled advertising in key markets.
   For the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, HBJ lost $55 million
on sales of $1.4 billion, compared with a net loss of $17 million
on sales of $1.2 billion for the same period last year.
   The company earlier this month announced plans to raise $500
million from the sale of junk bonds and common stock. Executives
recently returned from meetings in Europe to tout the securities.
   ``They couldn't come out with this deal with a quarter that was
horrendous,'' said Elizabeth Bramwell, an analyst at Gabelli &amp; Co.
in New York. ``You can't come out and sell stock when a quarter is
really disappointing financially.''

<TEXT>
   The original Baby Shamu, the first killer
whale born and raised successfully in captivity, will be taken away
from her mother this month to become the star of her own Sea World
show in Ohio.
   Florida's Department of Natural Resources has authorized the
separation and transfer from the Sea World marine park in Orlando _
the first time a captive killer whale has been intentionally
separated from its mother, state officials say. Federal wildlife
officials also agreed to the move.
   The company doesn't expect the move to affect either the mother
or her 5-year-old offspring, a Sea World spokesman said Thursday.
   ``We really anticipate no problems at all,'' said Nick
Gollatscheck.
   Researchers who study the marine mammals in the wild say they
live in pods or groups related on the mother's side. Many believe
killer whale offspring remain with their mothers throughout their
lifetime, but some biologists dispute this theory.
   Ed Asper, zoological director for the Orlando Sea World, said
the bonds between Baby Shamu and her mother, Katina, have weakened
because the mother has since had another offspring.
   In addition to Baby Shamu, now known by the stage name of Shamu,
the Florida park has five other killer whales.
   The Aurora, Ohio, Sea World now has two killer whales. One of
those animals will be moved to another of the Sea World parks, but
company officials would not say which one.
   Sea World applied for a state permit to move the whale last
month, and the agency conducted an investigation before granting a
transport permit.
   ``The primary concern was the condition of the facilities at Sea
World (in Ohio),'' said Charles Futch, an assistant director of
marine resources for DNR in Tallahassee.
   An inspection certificate signed Thursday by the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, a branch of the U.S. Agriculture
Department, concluded that killer whale tanks in Ohio met federal
standards.
   The DNR then approved the move to take place by Feb. 28.
   Shamu and two Pacific white-sided dolphins will be placed in
special stretchers and flown to the Aurora park, which will open
for the season around Memorial Day, officials said.

   Shares of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. continued to slide in heavy trading yesterday, amid speculation that a bidding war for the Orlando, Fla.-based publishing company may not materialize after all. 

   Harcourt is the target of a previously reported $44-a-share, or $1.73 billion, offer from British Printing &amp; Communications Inc., which is controlled by Robert Maxwell. 
Harcourt stock, which soared $16.125 a share after the announcement Monday and rose another $1.375 Tuesday to $48, fell $1 on Wednesday and closed yesterday at $45.75, down $1.25, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Volume totaled more than 1.9 million shares, making Harcourt the fourth-most active issue. 

   Harcourt's feisty chairman and chief executive officer, William Jovanovich, has retained First Boston Corp. to help prepare a defense against Mr. Maxwell, but Harcourt isn't understood to be actively shopping itself to potential buyers. 
Yet Wall Street sources said they expect increasing pressure will be put on Harcourt to boost its stock price. 
Sources said that before the company talks with Mr. Maxwell, its investment bankers may first attempt to explore the possibility of a stock buyback or to find a friendly buyer. 

   Meanwhile, Harcourt plowed ahead with a meeting of shareholders scheduled for this morning, defying both Mr. Maxwell and some of Harcourt's own institutional holders. 
Harcourt had called the meeting on May 4 -- before Mr. Maxwell's bid -- to seek approval for doubling its authorized common shares to 100 million, needed to proceed with a planned public offering of 8.6 million common shares. 
It currently has about 39.4 million shares outstanding. 

   Mr. Maxwell said yesterday in an interview that he hasn't received a response to his request to meet with Mr. Jovanovich to discuss "all matters, including price," in his bid. 
He added that he doesn't plan at present to make a hostile tender offer for Harcourt. 
But Mr. Maxwell said he might consider sweetening his bid if his advisers or Harcourt convince him that the company is worth more than $44 a share, or if a higher competing bid emerges. 

   But some Wall Street publishing specialists and industry executives questioned whether another bid will be made, at least from another major publishing company. 
A number of publishing concerns that had been thought to be potential rival bidders or friendly suitors for Harcourt have made it clear they aren't interested -- at least not in the whole company. 
A spokesman for McGraw-Hill Inc., which had been rumored to be a primary candidate, said yesterday, "We are not interested in Harcourt Brace and won't be a white knight." 

   Gulf &amp; Western Inc. and Time Inc. both declined to comment on reports they might bid for Harcourt, but executives at both companies said privately that they weren't interested in acquiring Harcourt, though they might be interested in picking off pieces, should assets be put up for sale. 

   Mr. Maxwell said he had been assured by News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch that he wouldn't be a rival bidder. 
Mr. Murdoch couldn't be reached for comment, but Martin Singerman, who heads News Corp.'s publishing operations, said that "as far as we know, there is nothing going on here and no interest in Harcourt" at present. 
News Corp. recently purchased Harper &amp; Row Inc. for about $200 million. 

   Though Mr. Jovanovich owns a scant 1% of Harcourt's stock, his mercurial manner is viewed as a roadblock to most other publishers. 
One Wall Street executive familiar with Mr. Jovanovich said that finding a friendly buyer will be difficult. 
"Another publishing company will want to move the operation to New York and Mr. Jovanovich isn't going to allow that," he said, adding, "Jovanovich can be a difficult fellow to deal with. 
There aren't going to be a lot of takers." 

   A top publishing attorney, who asked not to be identified, said that "if there's an overbid, it could come from a surprising direction outside the publishing industry," such as a company "interested in education or amusement parks." 
He added that Harcourt might be a good fit for Walt Disney Co. or MCA Inc., both of which have media and entertainment interests and operate theme park attractions. 
Harcourt is a leading educational publisher and owns Sea World marine parks. 
A Disney spokesman said he "couldn't speculate on what has been a rumor" that Disney might be interested in acquiring Harcourt. 
He said Harcourt is "considered a good competitor" to Walt Disney World in Orlando through Harcourt's Orlando-based Sea World operation. 
MCA officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Publishing industry executives also said that another foreign bidder could emerge. 

   Mr. Maxwell said he wasn't aware of any other bid in the works, but he added, "It's no secret that everyone on the Street . . . is working out what they ought to do about it." 

   Charles Harris, a Harcourt lawyer, said the planned stock offering that is the subject of today's holder meeting "was in no way intended as a defense against" a possible suitor. 
But it would make any takeover much more expensive, and Mr. Maxwell has said he won't pursue his current bid if new shares are issued. 

   Moreover, some of Harcourt's largest holders are lining up against the stock proposal. 
At least one institution that owns several hundred thousand shares switched its vote after Mr. Maxwell emerged and now opposes the proposal to increase authorized shares. 
"Obviously, you don't want another nine million shares floating around out there, making a takeover impossible," griped one institutional investor. 
"I can't believe Harcourt hasn't canceled this meeting." 

   Despite such opposition, several analysts suggested that Harcourt's intention to hold the meeting signals that the company already has enough proxy votes to win approval of the plan. 
Harcourt declined to comment on any aspect of its strategy. 

   Some on Wall Street have speculated that Harcourt may attempt a recapitalization or a leveraged buyout. 
But in Harcourt's 1985 annual report, Mr. Jovanovich said the company "will never engage in a leveraged buyout of the company designed to include its own management among the new private owners." 
He has previously described such buyouts as "despicable." 
In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. 
Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.

<HEAD>Posts Wider Loss Due to Higher Interest Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., the publishing,
insurance and theme park concern, said Thursday its loss widened in
the first quarter when its interest costs soared sixfold.
   But the company's operating loss narrowed from a year ago, and
officials noted that the first quarter often is weak because of the
seasonality of the educational publishing and amusement park
businesses.
   The higher interest expenses resulted from heavy borrowing last
year as the company financed a recapitalization to thwart a hostile
takeover effort.
   Harcourt, based in Orlando, Fla., said it lost $35.5 million in
the three months ended March 31 in contrast to a loss of $9.4
million in the same quarter last year.
   Its revenue for the quarter rose 7.4 percent to $306.7 million
from $285.7 million a year earlier.
   The company said its operating loss before the recapitalization
charges narrowed to $13.5 million from $47.3 million a year earlier.
   ``We are pleased with the results because have been able to
reduce our first quarter operating loss by about 70 percent from
last year,'' said John F. Berardi, Harcourt's vice president and
treasurer.
   Harcourt's interest expense climbed six-fold to $67.2 million
from $11.2 million a year earlier.
   It said revenue from its publishing operations rose 2 percent to
$128.5 million for the quarter, but its loss from publishing
operations narrowed to $26.6 million from $39.2 million.
   The company is a leading publisher of school textbooks, and the
first quarter is normally weak because of ordering patterns in that
business.
   Revenue from theme parks, including the Sea World parks in
Florida, California and Ohio, rose 26.8 percent to $61.0 million,
while income from park operations fell 7.2 percent to $4.0 million.
   Insurance revenue rose 4.5 percent to $117.1 million and the
company reported income of $10.9 million from insurance operations
in contrast to a loss of $6.6 million a year earlier that included
a pretax charge of $15.2 million for the relocation of the
company's insurance operations to Florida from Michigan.
   The latest results also included a $3.2 million gain on the sale
of land.

   To fans of Marineland, erstwhile home of killer whales Orky and Corky, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. is nothing less than a corporate Captain Ahab. 

   The big textbook publisher bought Marineland, an aquatic park south of Los Angeles, for $23.4 million late last year and announced renovation plans. 
But two months later, Harcourt closed the 33-year-old attraction, fired its 300 employees and decided to sell the prime real estate. 

   Some Marineland devotees speculate that Harcourt was only angling for the ocean-front property and never planned to continue running the park -- which happens to have been a competitor of Harcourt's San Diego Sea World, a hundred miles down the coast. 
Robert Ryan, a Rancho Palos Verdes city councilman, even speculates that Orky, the male whale, was the main lure, because of the cetacean's proven breeding ability. 

   Harcourt sees nothing villainous in its actions. 
Jack Snyder, an executive vice president, says the Orlando, Fla.-based company had planned to continue operating Marineland, but then found that $25 million in unexpected improvements were needed -- especially a new five million gallon aquarium for Orky and his mate. 

   Mr. Snyder concedes that Harcourt's land company then became "very excited" about the prospect of developing the real estate -- at least until the park's closure made such waves that Harcourt decided to just sell the land instead. 

   Meanwhile, Orky and the rest of the trained animals have already been shipped to the company's Sea World stables. 

   "It's clear we became persona non grata in Rancho Palos Verdes," a Harcourt lawyer says. 
A citizens group there has collected 25,000 signatures against the closing and is threatening to boycott Harcourt schoolbooks. 
Under the circumstances, chances of getting local clearance for a real-estate development were "between slim and none," the lawyer adds. 

   Mr. Snyder insists Harcourt's action on Marineland represented a "fall-back position," available if the company concluded the park couldn't profitably make a splash. 
Besides, in a poetic news release explaining the closing, Harcourt assured the community that "the publisher of Carl Sandburg and T.S. Elliott (sic) does not desecrate what it touches." 

   But, asks Mr. Ryan, who can believe Harcourt when it can't even get T.S. Eliot's name right? 
Now that charge ruffles Mr. Snyder: "It was just a typo, a clerk's error, that's all."

NEW DECADE ECONOMIC VIEW OF S.D.

San Diego's increasingly diversified economy kept humming right along in 1989, 
with job and economic growth outperforming that of both the state and nation. 
But pundits were uncertain at year's end how well the region would withstand 
the deep cuts in defense spending planned by the Bush Administration for coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989, the San Diego region lost the headquarters of several publicly 
owned companies and financial institutions to mergers and acquisitions, lending 
substance to San Diego's image of being, essentially, a branch office town. 
Such an image would be reinforced if the proposed merger of San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric by SCEcorp, now midway through its second year of hearings and legal 
skirmishing, goes through. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism continued to flourish in 1989, with another bumper crop of visitors 
expected in 1990 with the new San Diego Convention Center heading into its 
first full year of trade shows and conventions. The center is expected to pull 
up to 14,000 additional visitors into San Diego each week, adding $250 million 
to 1990 visitor spending. 
</P>
<P>
And foreign manufacturers continued to flock to Baja California to set up 
maquiladoras, the in-bond plants where goods destined for the U.S. market are 
made with low cost Mexican labor. What was different in 1989 was that two heavy 
industrial manufacturers, Hyundai and Louisiana-Pacific, announced plans to set 
up operations in Tijuana and Ensenada, respectively. Heretofore, the 
overwhelming majority of maquiladoras have involved the assembly of components 
shipped in from foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego gross regional product, the sum of goods and services produced, 
grew by 4.6% in 1989, according to Wells Fargo Bank economist Joseph Wahed. 
That's down from the growth rates of the previous two years but still ahead of 
the state and U.S. overall. Jobs in San Diego County increased 3.7% to 1.1 
million over the year and the unemployment rate as of October was 3.8%, a full 
percentage point less than the state's. 
</P>
<P>
But the good times in San Diego over the past decade have been fueled in no 
small measure by the defense build-up sought by the Reagan Administration. And 
those dollars could drop off substantially if the Bush Administration carries 
out its aim to reduce defense spending by as much as $180 billion over a 
three-year period beginning in the 1991 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Direct defense expenditures in the county totaled $9.7 billion last year, or 
more than 20% of the county's gross regional product, and should come in at 
roughly the same amount in 1989, according to the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce's economic research department. Since 1975, defense spending has risen 
here nearly fivefold from $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Local economists generally view the San Diego economy as being diversified 
enough now to avoid the devastation that defense spending cuts wrought in the 
early 1960s. Still, any significant spending cut will be felt in a county that 
is home to 144,000 uniformed service men and women, 34,000 civilian employees 
and an estimated 72,000 workers directly involved in defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
There was a rash of acquisitions of locally based public companies and banks by 
outsiders during the year, including Gen-Probe (acquired by Chugai 
Pharmaceutical), Monitor Technologies (Lear Siegler Measurement Controls), 
Pancretec (Abbott Laboratories), Smith Laboratories (proposed merger with 
Columbia Hospital Corp.), Torrey Pines Bank (Wells Fargo), La Jolla Bank &amp; 
Trust and Southwest Bank (both by Security Pacific Corp.) 
</P>
<P>
Western Health Plans, parent of Greater San Diego Health Plan, filed for 
bankruptcy and sold its membership to a group of local hospitals. Both Syntro 
and Henley Group moved their headquarters away from San Diego and Cipher Data 
Products, which last month received an unsolicited takeover bid from Archive 
Corp. of Costa Mesa, could be on the verge of disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
The local business community was startled by the arrest of Yuba Natural 
Resources Chairman Richard Silberman in April in connection with attempted 
money laundering, one of a host of problems that the San Diego-based gold 
mining company faced. Silberman is the husband of county supervisor Susan 
Golding, a former partner of Jack in the Box fast food chain founder Robert O. 
Peterson and a former state cabinet secretary under California Governor Jerry 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The three major savings and loans headquartered in San Diego -- HomeFed Bank, 
Great American Bank and Imperial Savings -- each faced problems of varying 
degrees of seriousness in 1989 as did many other U.S. thrifts. All were 
knuckling under tough new capital standards imposed by the federal S&amp;L 
rescue bill passed over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Savings President Kenneth Thygerson, who resigned in July, saw the 
defeat of his "nontraditional" approach to S&amp;L management when ICA's junk 
bond portfolio of investments lost more than $200 million in market value, 
resulting in write-downs that left the S&amp;L with a negative net worth at 
year's end and vulnerable to a federal takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Great American continued to wrestle with its troubled Arizona loan portfolio 
which so far has caused the S&amp;L to take more than $100 million in loan loss 
reserves. Even HomeFed, the strongest of the three local thrifts, saw its stock 
price drop precipitously on reports of problems with its real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
A bright light in the local economic firmament was tourism. Visitor spending 
for the first 10 months of 1989 was up 5% over the previous year to $2.6 
billion. Total visitors were up 1.6% and hotel room nights sold rose 2.8%. The 
San Diego Convention Center which opened in late November but which will host 
its first full fledged convention this month, should bump those tourism 
increases up to even higher levels in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World of San Diego, one of the area's top tourist draws, was sold by parent 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, along with five other theme parks, to Anheuser-Busch 
for $1.1 billion. The sale was necessitated by the need to pay down debt 
incurred by HBJ's costly restructuring in 1987.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said that it completed its $334.1 million sale of two units to an investor group and that it doesn't plan to sell any other assets. 

   In New York, Robert L. Edgell, a former Harcourt Brace vice chairman who leads the investor group, said he will head a new Cleveland-based publishing company, Edgell Communications Inc., comprising HBJ Publications Inc., a magazine and trade show unit, and HBJ Beckley-Cardy Inc., a school supplier. 
The company, Mr. Edgell said, would pursue an "aggressive" acquisition policy. 

   In confirming the sale, Harcourt Brace Chairman William Jovanovich denied earlier reports that the publishing, insurance and theme park company was considering putting its theme park operations on the block. 
"No other parts of HBJ, including the six theme parks, are for sale," Mr. Jovanovich said in a prepared statement. 

   Mr. Edgell said that in December, Mr. Jovanovich told him he was "fed up" with the company's theme park operations and would consider selling them for $2.5 billion. 

   Previously, Harcourt Brace said it would use the proceeds from the sale of the two units to help offset the cost of its $3 billion recapitalization plan, the company's defense last year against a failed takeover attempt by Maxwell Communication Corp. 

   Since adopting the plan, Harcourt Brace has sold more than $370 million of assets, including the two units, a sum that Mr. Jovanovich said fulfills Harcourt Brace's commitments to the banks that financed the recapitalization.

Two Tough Competitors in a Face-Off Over Harcourt

Longtime Chief Jovanovich

As 'Favorite Offspring'

   William Jovanovich, head of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., started in the publishing business by hawking books on passenger trains. 
Now, he doesn't particularly want anybody else on board -- especially Robert Maxwell. 

   "Let me put it this way," Mr. Jovanovich said yesterday of the British communications baron who is trying to take over Harcourt. 
"Mr. 
Maxwell has been roundly denounced by everyone (for past business practices). 
He's a wheeler-dealer and he's been in all sorts of scrapes and he's got a whole pyramid of Liechtenstein companies. 
It's hard to say who he really is." 

   At the moment, Mr. Maxwell is the instigator of an unsolicited, $1.73 billion offer for the publishing company. 
The bid poses the biggest threat in years to the 67-year-old Mr. Jovanovich's long domination of Harcourt. 
Tough, abrasive and iron-willed, he has been chief executive officer for 32 years, chairman for 17. 
He has transformed Orlando, Fla.-based Harcourt from a pipsqueak New York book company into a far-flung publishing, entertainment and insurance conglomerate with 1986 revenue of $968.6 million. 

   A friend calls Harcourt Mr. Jovanovich's "favorite offspring" and he is expected to pull out all the stops to protect his baby. 
"When you've built a company as he has, it becomes a monument, a matter of personal pride," says Everette Huskey, an Orlando real estate man who knows Mr. Jovanovich. 
"You can expect him to fight like hell to protect it." 

   He is likely to fight all the harder because it is Mr. Maxwell who is after him. 
Mr. Jovanovich clearly has little use for Mr. Maxwell and has called his $44-a-share offer for Harcourt "preposterous." 
Indeed, investors seemed to agree, indicating anticipation of a sweetened bid, as Harcourt yesterday rose $1.375 a share, to close at $48, after jumping $16.125 Monday when the bid was announced. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Harcourt was the most-active issue for the second consecutive day, on volume of more than 5.2 million shares. 

   Mr. Jovanovich has drawn his initial line of defense on Mr. Maxwell's past. 
He mentioned a 1971 British government inquiry into some of Mr. Maxwell's dealings that found the executive "unfit to run a public company," a charge of which Mr. Maxwell said he had been exonerated. 
Noting that Harcourt is the biggest textbook publisher in the U.S., Mr. Jovanovich ticked off a list of Mr. Maxwell's supposed faults and concluded: "Do I want the largest educational publisher in the world in the hands of this man? 
Of course not. 
He's not qualified." 

   His distaste for Mr. Maxwell, who made his offer through British Printing &amp; Communications Corp., also may stem from huge differences in personal style and outlook. 
Unlike the flamboyant Mr. Maxwell, Mr. Jovanovich is private, almost reclusive. 
He doesn't court Wall Street analysts or institutional investors -- traits that could hurt him now that a takeover battle is on. 

   And while Mr. Maxwell is a Socialist, Mr. Jovanovich's own rags-to-riches background has made him a "full-blooded capitalist," says one acquaintance. 
Born of immigrant parents in a Colorado coal camp, Mr. Jovanovich clawed his way from salesman to the presidency of Harcourt at the age of 34, after only eight years with the company. 
He has written several books and has edited the works of writers ranging from Mark Helprin to Milton Friedman. 
"He's a very creative and brilliant individual," says Charles Harris, a Harcourt lawyer. 

   Mr. Jovanovich has steered the business into areas that once made him the butt of jokes but now promise to make lots of money. 
In 1984, he moved Harcourt's headquarters from New York to Orlando, then commonly known as "Borelando." 
But the move saved millions of dollars a year in rent and other expenses and plunked the company down in what would soon be one of the fastest-growing regions of the country. 

   He also pushed into the theme park business, setting up Harcourt's successful Sea World marine parks to compete with, among others, Walt Disney Co. Competitors joked that the parks were Mickey Mouse, but they contributed about a quarter of Harcourt's $152 million of operating profit in 1986, when Harcourt had net income of $70.5 million, or $1.91 a share, on revenue $968.6 million. 

   Mr. Jovanovich's drive to build the company, however, has bulldozed many a career, former employees say. 
Hiram Haydn, Harcourt's co-publisher from 1964 to 1973, says, "He was not beyond using the flat of the broadsword to batter someone into submission." 
There is also a streak of vanity in Mr. Jovanovich, acquaintances say: For years he has kept a collection of his own essays -- called "Now Barabbas" -- on display on a glass table in his opulent Orlando office. 
Even his wife and children refer to him in conversations as "the chairman." 

   Yet Mr. Jovanovich has had his share of publishing embarrassments. 
Harcourt had to pull from bookstores a biography it published about Washington Post Co.'s chairman and chief executive officer, Katharine Graham, because of alleged inaccuracies. 
The book, by Deborah Davis, suggested that Post editor Benjamin Bradlee was a CIA agent. 
The author sued Harcourt and reportedly later settled for $100,000. 

   Though Mr. Jovanovich says Harcourt has nothing to fear from Mr. Maxwell, the feverish trading in Harcourt stock since the bid could make trying to save the company in its current form an uphill battle. 
Since Monday, the value of Harcourt shares has surged 57%; much of the stock now is in the hands of others who will push for an agreement. 
"The stock's obviously in play," said Bert Boksen, a broker with Raymond James Financial Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
"Once these deals build a certain momentum, it's very difficult to just sit still and do nothing." 

   Harcourt is limited in how it can respond if the threat persists. 
Its heavy debt load -- 56% of capitalization at year's end -- cuts off many restructuring avenues. 
Mr. Jovanovich has called leveraged buyouts "despicable," so that escape route seems out. 
Analysts say Harcourt could raise $600 million to $700 million by selling the theme parks and use the proceeds to buy back stock, but Mr. Jovanovich would be loath to do that. 

   Mr. Jovanovich doesn't believe it will come to any of that. 
He says nobody could possibly run the company better than he has, not Mr. Maxwell, not anyone. 
"What do you expect a man to say, that he's given 40 years of his life to something and it has all been a mistake?" he says. 
Then he turns philosophical. 
"It's like a minor league ball player once said: Life is hard and then you die."

Ex-Officers of Sea World Plan Bid: Three former Sea World executives said they 
plan to submit an offer to buy four Sea Worlds and two other amusement parks 
that were put up for sale last month by parent Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. 
Former executives Jan Schultz, Robert Hillebrecht and George Millay declined to 
say how much their offer will be, but analysts have estimated that the six 
parks plus 1,200 acres of raw land could fetch $1.4 billion to $2 billion.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said it will issue new bonds and stock valued at about $500 million as part of a new refinancing plan to ease the terms of its $3 billion recapitalization program. 

   The publishing and theme park concern, based in Orlando, Fla., said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue 10 million shares of common stock, $200 million in senior notes due 1997 and $200 million in subordinated debentures due 2004. 

   Under the refinancing plan, the company said it would use proceeds from the bond sales to pay down its approximately $1.3 billion bank debt while using cash from the stock sale, expected to be about $100 million, for working capital. 
Bank lenders, in turn, agreed to extend the maturity of the remaining debt to 1996 from 1993, to ease the debt amortization requirements, and to modify "certain covenants" of its debt agreements, the concern said. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Harcourt closed Friday at $10.75, down 25 cents. 

   William Jovanovich, chairman and chief executive officer, hailed the initiative as the final step in the costly recapitalization program undertaken last year to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by British media magnate Robert Maxwell. 

   "This is a triumph," he said in an interview. 
"It's the culmination of 17 months of getting us to the place I want us to be, which is public, whole and independent." 

   Mr. Jovanovich said he had expected to refinance the bank debt ever since the recapitalization was announced, because the repayment period, six years, was unusually short. 
He said all of the company's bank lenders, more than 40 in all, agreed to the new plan. 

   In part, the announcement appeared aimed at silencing speculation that the company might be forced by its debt burden to sell additional assets, such as one or more of its Sea World theme parks or its insurance operations. 
Indeed, Mr. Jovanovich said the refinancing accord specifically prohibits the sale of additional operating assets. 

   "I am tired of that speculation, it's absolutely not true," Mr. Jovanovich said. 
"I'd like to get out of the news and just publish." 
He said sales of real estate assets would still be permitted under the new agreement. 

   The company said it also is planning to redeem $83.6 million in preferred stock to reduce the nearly 20% annualized dividend burden. 
Funds for the redemption will come from working capital and from the private placement of a $53.6 million convertible note, with interest of 9 3/4%, a Harcourt adviser said. 

   Despite the company's optimism, at least one analyst warned that the refinancing merely postpones the day of reckoning for Harcourt's costly attempt to stay independent. 
The move "means they're in the soup and they have to bring a lot of money down to equity," contends Ivan Obolensky, a senior vice president at Josephthal &amp; Co. Inc., New York. 

   "What you've got are cash flows that are extremely strong but that are falling short of principal payments," said Bert Boksen, a senior analyst at Raymond James Financial Corp., St. Petersburg, Fla. 
"This is a very good company," but "it is in a survival mode," he added. 

   In the second quarter, Harcourt reported a net loss of $44.6 million, on sharply increased revenue of $318.2 million.

<TEXT>
   William Jovanovich has resigned as chairman of
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. and his successor at the publishing
company is former U.S. Energy Secretary John S. Herrington.
   ``Forty-three years is enough, especially since I now can devote
my time to editing books and writing them,'' Jovanovich, 70, said
in a statement issued today by the Orlando, Fla.-based company.
   Jovanovich is the author of several novels and one is scheduled
for release in the fall. He edited Mary McCarthy until her death
last November and currently edits Diana Trilling.
   During Jovanovich's tenure, the company's revenue grew from $8
million in the 1950s to $1.3 billion. The company's authors include
Alice Walker, Umberto Eco, Mark Helprin and Charles Simic, who won
the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for poetry. The company also publishes
scientific and medical books and journals and operates a large
insurance business as well.
   Jovanovich arranged an infusion of capital in 1987 that enabled
the company to avoid a takeover by British media baron Robert
Maxwell. But the resulting heavy debt prompted the company to sell
its six theme parks, including four Sea World parks.
   Herrington has served as a member of the Harcourt board since
May 1989. He called Jovanovich ``an American publishing legend, a
pioneer in educational technology and an industry giant who built
the best independent publishing house in America.''
   The company issued a statement that Jovanovich also had
submitted his resignation as chairman of the company's executive
committee.
   He will be replaced in that position by his son, Peter
Jovanovich, 41, who was named chief executive and president of the
company last December.
   Herrington, 51, served as energy secretary in the Reagan
administration from February 1985 to January 1989. He had been
assistant secretary of the Navy from 1981 to 1983.

   Drained by losses of more than $1 million a week,
Braniff Inc. became the first major airline to seek bankruptcy
protection a second time after canceling nearly all its flights and
laying off more than half its work force.
   Some airline experts say a cash shortage and intense competition
from larger carriers may keep Braniff from re-enacting its comeback
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1984 as a smaller company.
   Braniff left thousands of travelers seeking alternate flights
and ticket refunds Thursday as it halted all but four flights

   The House approved President Bush's proposed
cut in capital-gains taxes, rejecting arguments of Democratic
leaders that it would bring a windfall for the rich at the expense
of a bigger budget deficit.
   A nearly solid bloc of Republicans was joined by 64 Democrats,
chiefly from timber and farm areas, in Thursday's 239-190 vote to
redeem Bush's campaign promise to tax investment income at a lower
rate than wages.
   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the proposal would cut
taxes for 8 million couples and individuals, with 80 percent of the
benefit going to those with total yearly incomes above $100,000.

   Despite public misgivings by the Bush
administration, officials of the International Monetary Fund
predicted ultimate victory in their campaign to dramatically
increase their lending resources.

   Borden Inc. announced a double-pronged program
that will cut its work force by about 15 percent and substantially
shrink its dairy business, symbolized for decades by Elsie the cow.
   The program announced Thursday, which will mean the cutting of
7,000 jobs, comes after several years of acquisitions, which added
$3.1 billion to Borden's annual sales.
   Borden will take a $571 million pre-tax charge against its
third-quarter income, resulting in a quarterly loss of $300 million
to $305 million.

   Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc. said Wednesday
its third-quarter profit rose 5.2 percent from a year ago on a
revenue increase of 6.1 percent, but warned that price cutting
could slow future earnings growth.
   The company, which is the world's largest brewer and also makes
snack foods, said earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $238
million, or 83 cents per share, up from $226 million, or 78 cents
per share, last year.
   Sales in the quarter rose to $2.70 billion from $2.55 billion in
1988.
   The company said it sold a record 21.4 million barrels of beer
in the quarter, up 4.2 percent from a year ago.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company said its beer
sales accounted for 41.9 percent of the industry's sales, up from
40.6 percent as year earlier.
   But August A. Busch III, chairman and president, said
Anheuser-Busch is being challenged by competitors who have begun to
heavily discount their premium brands.
   ``We have been very reluctant to discount our high quality
premium brands to the same extent as our competitors,'' Busch said.
But he said some discounting is required to avoid further losses in
sales volume.
   Busch said the financial impact of the price cuts will be lower
earnings growth than anticipated for the last half of 1989 and the
year 1990. But he said the move should eventually pay off in an
even stronger market position and in higher earnings.
   For the first nine months, the company earned $639 million, or
$2.23 per share, up 8.2 percent from $590.4 million, or $2.01 per
share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales of $7.3 billion in the first three quarters of
last year.
   The company recently agreed to purchase four Sea World Parks,
two other theme parks and certain land near the parks from Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich Inc. for $1.1 billion. The deal is expected to be
closed in November, Anheuser-Busch said.

   Sea World trainers have returned to the water
to train with killer whales under stricter safety guidelines, but
no performances with humans and the giant mammals together are
scheduled.
   ``I would say that the biggest change is in the raised
experience level of the trainers,'' said Michael Scarpuzzi, the
marine park's new director of training. ``From now on, trainers
have to have a minimum of four years of experience before they can
even get in the water.''
   Scarpuzzi would not specify when the trainers would go back into
the pool for performances. But he said Wednesday it probably woudl
be soon.
   The trainers were ordered out of the water following a series of
accidents last year, including one in November in which a trainer
with two years of experience was critically hurt when a whale
landed on him during a show.
   In response, William Jovanovich, chairman of Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc., Sea World's parent company, ordered trainers out
of the water during shows and fired three executives. One of the
executives later was reinstated.
   Jovanovich also vowed that humans would never again enter the
water with killer whales, which had become a trademark of the
aquatic park.
   ``I don't think it was ever their intent to just say flat out,
`No,''' Scarpuzzi said. ``I know the chairman said that, but it was
said during a very emotional time.''

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., still struggling under a
mountain of debt incurred in a 1987 recapitalization, may
sell some of its publishing operations to Thomson Corp.
   Eugene McCarthy, a Harcourt director, said yesterday that
Harcourt's board met Monday to discuss the possible sale of
some of its assets to Thomson, the Toronto-based publishing
and travel concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Thomson hasn't asked to buy the whole company," Mr.
McCarthy said. "{It} has only been offered part of the
company."
   Mr. McCarthy, the former U.S. senator, said the two
companies have been in talks for the past month, although he
said he didn't know who initiated the discussions. Harcourt
late yesterday evening confirmed that it has "had discussion
with certain parties with respect to possible transactions."
Peter Jovanovich, Harcourt's president and chief executive
officer, said the possible transactions involve, among other
things, offers for some or all of the publishing and
insurance company's existing public debt at a discount from
its aggregate book value, as well as the acquisition of
certain assets of Harcourt by a third party.
   But Mr. Jovanovich declined to identify any third party or
what assets might be sold. He said that the discussions have
been preliminary and that no agreements have been reached. He
added that there is no assurance that negotiations will
progress or that a transaction will be completed.
   He also said in a prepared statement that Orlando,
Fla.-based Harcourt isn't for sale. Meanwhile, executives at
Thomson couldn't be reached for comment.
   For Harcourt, the sale of one of its publishing units
would mark another step in the unraveling of the company that
began in 1987. That was the year William Jovanovich,
Harcourt's chairman, engineered a $2.9 billion
recapitalization to evade a takeover by British publishing
mogul Robert Maxwell, plunging Harcourt into more than $2
billion of debt. The interest costs proved so onerous that
last summer -- despite previous denials that it would need to
shed assets -- the company sold its prized Sea World theme
parks for a $1.1 billion, a price below what analysts had
thought the parks were worth.
   In the past several months, as Harcourt's stock has
languished, many publishing-industry executives and analysts
have expected the company to sell more assets to help pay
down debt. But the company's apparent talks with Thomson
baffled some observers, who had identified Harcourt's
insurance units as the most likely candidates for
divestiture.
   "They have no business being in insurance," said one
publishing executive close to the company, "because nobody on
the board knows {anything} about it."
   Charles Elbaum, president of Publishing Economics Inc., a
consulting firm in New York, said Thomson is probably after
one or both of Harcourt's medical and scientific publishing
companies, Academic Press and W.B. Saunders. Both units
garner about $140 million in revenue per year and are
Harcourt's "crown jewels," Mr. Elbaum said, earning "very
significant" pre-tax profit margins.
   Another possible target is Harcourt's legal publishing
unit, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal &amp; Professional
Publishers Inc. While the unit is small, Thomson has a
demonstrated interest in acquiring similar specialty
publications. Last May it paid $810 million to buy Lawyers
Co-operative Publishing Co. in Rochester, N.Y., making
Thomson one of the top three legal publishers in the U.S.
   Harcourt's other major publishing arm, its elementary and
high school textbook division, has done poorly in the past 18
months after failing to meet changing demands by educators.
The unit became saddled with so many unwanted books that
Harcourt had to take an $88 million writeoff last year to
cover obsolete inventory.
   The apparent interest by Thomson in Harcourt's assets also
puzzled analysts, since Thomson has repeatedly said it wants
time to digest its 1989 acquisitions. In its annual report,
the company said that only outstanding opportunities will be
pursued.
   The Canadian concern would be able to finance such a
transaction with considerable ease, however. It is on record
as saying it doesn't want to move beyond a debt-to-equity
ratio of 1-to-1, which would still leave the company with
resources of about $1 billion to draw upon if acquisition
opportunities presented themselves.
   "I don't think Thomson would be interested in . . . all of
Harcourt," said Ella Brown, an analyst with Richardson
Greenshields in Toronto. "But they're likely to take a
serious look at some of the parts."
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Harcourt closed at $4.125, up 12.5 cents.
   Separately, a unit of Thomson, American Banker-Bond Buyer,
said it acquired the assets of Rand McNally &amp; Co.'s Financial
Publishing division.
   Terms weren't disclosed.
   American Banker-Bond Buyer is a New York information
company with specialty-publishing activities in banking,
securities and financial information services. Among its
publications are the national daily newspapers American
Banker and the Bond Buyer.
   With Rand McNally's Financial Publishing division, the
Thomson unit is getting a number of national and
international banking directories. Also, the division, with
about 75 employees, administers the routing numbers by which
checks are sorted and cleared through banks around the
country, under a contract with the American Bankers
Association.
   Rand McNally is a closely held publisher based in Skokie,
Ill.

   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC on Tuesday
confirmed that it is interested in buying some of the publishing
operations of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., the Florida-based
publishing concern.
   ``If and when the board of Harcourt decides to sell off assets
other than theme parks, we will be interested in acquiring them,''
Maxwell Communication said in a statement, confirming earlier
published reports.
   Maxwell Communication launched a hostile $1.7 billion offer for
Harcourt in 1987, but was thwarted when Harcourt recapitalized and
tripled the company's debt to $2.9 billion.
   In an effort to trim that debt, Harcourt sold its magazine and
school supply businesses, and in June announced plans to sell its
six theme parks businesses.
   Responding to a report Monday of Maxwell's interest in
Harcourt's publishing operations, Harcourt Chairman William
Jovanovich said Maxwell's comments were ``a footless attempt to
interfere'' in his company's business.
   He said plans to sell Harcourt's six theme parks and land were
``proceeding satisfactorily.''
   ``The company has no need and no intention to sell any other
part of its business,'' Jovanovich said in Monday's statement from
Orlando, Fla.
   Maxwell Communication last year acquired the U.S. publisher
Macmillan Inc. for $2.5 billion and Dun and Bradstreet Corp.'s
Official Airlines Guide for $750 million.

   Shamu, Namu and Kandu are readying a
killer of a sea show that organizers hope will fishtail with the
Alamo and the city's River Walk.
   While the killer whales swim around in a 7 million gallon tank,
gardeners are putting the final landscaping touches on Sea World of
Texas, a $140 million, 250-acre facility billed as the nation's
largest marine theme park.
   The park's ``Big Splash'' opening is set for May 28, but
workers, animals and trainers are already performing in rehearsals
for visitors.
   Sea World, 13 miles northwest of downtown San Antonio, will be
open year-round. It is expected to employ 2,000 people during its
peak summer season, generate a $25 million annual payroll and
attract 3 million visitors bearing another $300 million yearly for
the park's and South Texas' economies.
   City and tourist industry officials have looked at Sea World as
a magnet for tourists to help the state diversify from its
dependency on petroleum, but Sea World chairman George Becker warns
against expecting too much too soon.
   ``I've cautioned a few people that we'll do the very best that
we can, but not to rest on their laurels and expect us to be the
end-all and the answer to all of their business problems,'' he said.
   Visitors can expect to see the park's star, Shamu, a two-ton
killer whale that was among the fish and animals brought in from
three other Sea World parks around the country.
   Shamu will perform in a 4,500-seat stadium. At other, smaller
stadiums, dolphins, seals, sea lions, walruses and other animals
will show their stuff, too.
   Skiers will perform acrobatics in a 12-acre lake, and visitors
can walk across the United States via a one-acre ``map'' of the
country.
   There are restaurants, lounges, a disco for teen-agers and a
playground for children. There also is Cypress Gardens West, a
botanical center where a variety of flowers will bloom year-round.
   San Antonio tourism already generates more than $1 billion
annually, with lures like the Alamo and the River Walk.
   Texas is home to Six Flags of Texas in Arlington and to
AstroWorld in Houston, both of which attract about 1.7 million
visitors a year each.
   Tourist industry officials believe Sea World will help, not
hurt, those amusement parks.
   ``It's actually going to help them because it completes the
triangle of from San Antonio, Houston and the Dallas-Fort Worth
area,'' said Larry Todd, director of the Texas Tourist Agency.
   He said Sea World is following the lead of other tourist
attractions by promoting Texas first and its location second.
   ``I don't think tourism is a panacea, but it's all fresh, new
money and it's an immediate boost to the economy and it's rapidly
becoming one of our top industries,'' Todd said.
   ``We Texans had better face the fact that tourism is an industry
whose time has come. We have sat back and been dependent on oil and
agriculture and haven't needed tourism, and now all of a sudden we
need it and we need to market Texas intelligently,'' he said.
   (Sea World's one-day admission is $18.95 for adults and $15.95
for senior citizens (55 and older) and children 3-11. A 12-month
pass is $49 for adults and $39 for children. Founders Club pass,
available until May 28, is $125 and offers special discounts and is
good for admission through Dec. 31, 1991. Sea World sales office
number is 512-523-3400.)

<HL> Heard on the Street: Harcourt's Refinancing Draws Mixed Reviews As $400 Million of Junk Bonds Are Readied </HL>

<IN> HRD STK BON BBK TNM </IN>

   The refinancing strategy of William Jovanovich, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich's venerable chairman, is getting mixed reviews from investors. 

   The publishing company is braving a sloppy market to issue $400 million of junk bonds through First Boston. 
Late yesterday, the talk was that Harcourt's senior bonds might be priced to yield 12 7/8%. 
The junior bonds' figure was 14%, a tempting half percentage point more than the average junk bond. 

   The refinancing's goal was to extend the term of some bank loans that Harcourt couldn't really afford, investors say. 

   Mr. Jovanovich has characterized the offering as the final step in Harcourt's costly recapitalization, undertaken in 1987 to fend off media magnate Robert Maxwell's takeover bid. 
As part of the plan, Harcourt recently sold 10 million new common shares at $9.50 each. 

   Harcourt shares, before being targeted by short-sellers, were as high as 12 7/8 earlier this year but closed yesterday at 8 3/4, off 1/8. 
Before the refinancing was announced, Harcourt's older 13 3/4% bonds due 1999 had been winners, trading at prices as high as 105, or 105% of their face amount. 
They're now at around 102. 

   Wall Street's gripe: The refinancing will actually raise Harcourt's debt slightly to about $2.7 billion, as well as increase its interest bill. 
With the economy and markets currently so uncertain, Harcourt should instead be selling major assets to reduce debt, as Borg-Warner is doing, some bondholders say. 

   Equity investors complain that Harcourt shouldn't have sold stock at such a low price. 
The offering diluted all shareholders' interest in the company, including the 40% stake of Harcourt insiders and employees. 

   "This is undoubtedly the worst time to refinance," says one investor. 
"There's a big junk-bond calendar and the stock market feels crummy." 

   Harcourt is apparently using some money from its stock sale to redeem $83.6 million of preferred shares with very high dividends that are held by First Boston, partly offsetting the rise in Harcourt's interest bill. 

   Fidelity Investments' Richard Cryan, whose portfolios hold the publisher's older 13 3/4% bonds, says "Harcourt was never a liquidation story. 
It was always a cost-cutting and run-the-company story." 
But he'd like to see Harcourt sell its theme parks and retire debt. 
The parks might fetch $750 million, he says, although Harcourt might face heavy taxes on such a sale. 

   However, Mr. Jovanovich gets credit for running a taut ship since the recapitalization. 
And Mr. Cryan is cheered by rising cash flows at Harcourt's textbook and theme-park units. 
"At 14%," he says, its new junior bonds might "look attractive." 

   After Walt Disney, Harcourt is the second-biggest operator of theme parks. 
Its new Sea World of Texas is kicking in quite a bit of money, although analysts worry about declining attendance at most theme parks. 
Harcourt's textbooks are on a roll, especially in Texas and California, investors say. 

   Kidder Peabody says Harcourt's cash flow from operations should rise to roughly $425 million in 1989, from perhaps $370 million in 1988. 
It says 1989's cash flow should be 1.3 times its total interest expense. 
A lot of Harcourt's interest is deferred and needn't be paid in cash until the early 1990s. 

   There's a nagging fear Mr. Jovanovich might make more acquisitions. 
In 1986, Harcourt bought Holt Rinehart &amp; Winston and W.B. Saunders. 
But John Berardi, Harcourt's treasurer, says "our existing bank agreement doesn't allow additional borrowing" until 1996. 
He indicates Harcourt's 1989 cash flow might be $500 million, before capital spending of $105 million at most. 

   Mr. Berardi says Harcourt's high bond yields reflect market conditions, not lack of faith in the company. 
Senior Harcourt managers have recently bought Harcourt stock and bonds and "I intend to," he says. 
Harcourt thinks its assets "are appreciating" and "feels comfortable" with its debts now that bank loans are extended an extra three years, he adds. 

   Harcourt is among the most leveraged of junk-bond issuers, according to Drexel Burnham Lambert's measure. 
It still has negative shareholders equity of about $1.4 billion. 
And its seasonal businesses in some periods this year have shown negative cash flow, says Gerald Unterman of Solomon Asset Management in New York. 

   But the money manager owns many Harcourt bonds and shares. 
Sale of the publishing unit alone would suffice to pay all debt "if the world falls apart," he says. 
At 14%, the new junior bonds would yield five percentage points more than 20-year Treasury bonds, he says, adding: "That's very cheap." 
Harcourt has "a nice big conservative banker, J.P. Morgan," he says. 

   Stock-analyst Bert Boksen of Raymond James says Harcourt may have had little choice in refinancing. 
He says it faced a $60 million cash-flow shortfall in 1989. 
"It had $175 million of debt installments due in 1989," he says. 
"That was the problem." 
Principal due in 1989 is now only $30 million.

<HEAD>Reports Smaller Loss in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said Tuesday
it lost $23 million in the second quarter compared with a loss of
$42.6 million for the same period a year earlier.
   The smaller loss reflected higher revenue from publishing and
insurance operations, cost reductions in publishing and lower
interest expenses due to the paydown of debt with proceeds from
asset sales, the company said.
   The company has a $1.6 billion debt, much of it taken on when it
thwarted a hostile takeover offer in 1987.
   Harcourt also said its annual meeting of shareholders, which was
scheduled for September 1990, will be rescheduled for a later date.
   On a per-share basis, the company said it lost 39 cents for the
three months ended June 30 compared with a loss of 84 cents in the
same quarter in 1989.
   Revenue rose 6.1 percent to $348.5 million in the quarter from
$328.6 million a year earlier.
   The company's publishing operations reported income from
operations of $34.7 million in the quarter, up 39.4 percent from a
year earlier, as revenue rose 2.7 percent to $227 million.
   Income from insurance operations rose 11.6 percent to $10.6
million in the quarter as revenue rose 13 percent to $121.5 million.
   Interest expense fell to $66 million from $91.6 million a year
earlier.
   For the first half, the company reported it lost $94.9 million,
or $1.47 a share, compared with a loss of $158.7 million, or $2.64
a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first half rose 9.7 percent to $625.4 million
from $570.2 million a year earlier.
   The company said its first half revenues are not indicative of
the entire year because the publishing business is highly seasonal,
with the majority of revenues and operating profits coming in
during the third quarter.
   Harcourt undertook a $3 billion recapitalization in 1987 after
an unsolicited buyout offer from Britain's Robert Maxwell. As part
of the plan, the company borrowed heavily to pay special dividends
to shareholders.
   Last fall, Harcourt sold its Sea World theme parks for $1.1
billion in an effort to reduce its debt.
   In June, longtime Harcourt chairman William I. Jovanovich
resigned and was replaced by John S. Herrington, a former secretary
of energy during the Reagan administration.
   The job of running the company has fallen to Jovanovich's son,
Peter, who has been chief executive of the company since last
December.
   Many analysts say HBJ generates enough cash to meet its interest
obligations over the next 18 months to two years.
   But they have warned that trouble could develop in 1992 when
cash payments start coming due on preferred stock and bonds which
now are issuing additional securities as dividends.
   They say the company will have to either sell assets, reschedule
debt payments or get a capital infusion to meet those obligations.
