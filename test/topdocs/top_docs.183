   Brooklyn, N.Y. -- Forget forsythia. Heck with witch hazel.
The woody shrub that makes this gardener's winter in the
deeps of January is, appropriately, winter honeysuckle.
Lonicera fragrantissima.
   On a recent 10-degree day, in full goosedown mufti, I
ventured into my Siberian cutting garden and picked myself
the most fragrant bouquet. My two honeysuckle bushes had been
blooming most fragrantly since Dec. 25, unassisted by burlap,
mulch or me.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Every winter, winter honeysuckle gets the jump on those
routinely touted winter-bloomers, snowdrops (Galanthus
nivalis) and winter aconite (Eranthis hyemalis), but the
latter get all the springharbinger ink. Winter honeysuckle
has fragrance -- presence -- the delicious perfume double of
Daphne odora. Furthermore, winter honeysuckle's axillary
pairs of demure white flowers bloom on a bush that is
evergreen in NYC. Witch hazel gets dependably good notices
for winter flowering (if you call those spidery,
desiccated-looking yellow micro-mops flowers), so does
forsythia. The winter-honeysuckle bush gets bashed, or
ignored.
   The latest underwhelming of the winter honeysuckle turns
up in "The Winter Garden" handbook just out from the Brooklyn
Botanic Garden. On page 48 we read that "the most-noted of
winter-flowering woody plants are the witch-hazels, which
bloom in the dead of winter, notwithstanding severe cold and
snow." (So? The least-noted winter honeysuckles do the same.)
A few pages later winter honeysuckle gets a nod for
fragrance, but not before it has been called "common" and
"rarely as spectacular in bloom as forsythia." (Despite
forsythia being the official flower of my home borough of
Brooklyn, I'm a forsythiaphobe: It's a yellow bore in bloom,
a gangly green bore in leaf, and totally inodorous.)
   As it happens, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is where
Lonicera fragrantissima first scored a technical knockout of
my olfactories, on a bleak winter walk in 1985, between the
Shakespeare Garden and the Herb Garden. As soon as I'd keyed
it out, I rather quickly determined that winter honeysuckle
was not in demand, a plant so far out of fashion I couldn't
find any place to buy it. (A helpful BBG librarian eventually
tracked down one of the four catalogs that carry it.) My
honeysuckle shrubs are 6-footers this winter, and blossoming
to beat the hibernal band.
   Muddling through January, at the photosynthetic nadir of
my year, I cannot understand why every gardener in the Frost
Belt isn't growing this extraordinarily obliging,
enchantingly fragranced, auto-antifreeze flower. I was
puzzled enough to spend the other day in the library of the
Horticultural Society of New York, studying Lonicera lit. Now
I think I understand why I don't know any other private
growers of winter honeysuckle and have only smelled the plant
at my place, at the BBG, the New York Botanical Garden and in
an ancient honeysuckle grove at the southwest corner of
Brooklyn's Prospect Park.
   Winter honeysuckle appears to be a victim of
Anglo-American plant snobbery. American gardeners, long
suffering an English gardening complex, have apparently been
taking their plant cues from the well-known English
gardener-writers whose books have swamped these shores the
past few decades, most of whom damn the winter honeysuckle
with the faintest of praise. Christopher Lloyd, "The
Well-Tempered Gardener," counts it in his 1987 book "among
the many winter-flowering shrubs of coarse habit and boring
appearance in summer." Bush honeysuckles, he decrees, "should
be sited out of the way."
   Garden romantic Stephen Lacey, in "The Startling Jungle"
(1990), finds fault with them for being plants that "direct
little energy towards the production of handsome flowers" and
for having "undistinguished foliage." (No points for four
months in bloom or easy forcing.) Romance gardeners should
put them "where they can spend the summer unobtrusively."
Despite their elegant scent, Mr. Lacey flogged them again
last year in "Scent in Your Garden": "They are all ungainly
in summer, being inelegant of habit and clothed in large
coarse leaves, and only detract from their companions in the
border."
   Had I but known. In my own American-primitive way I had
never thought to apply standards of elegance to my
honeysuckle bushes, and had found them handsome withal.
Unapologetically, I have grown them front and center, and
they have neither bored nor embarrassed me, winter or summer.
   I feel no different now that I have read Penelope
Hobhouse's Loniceriad in "The Country Gardener" (1989): "The
winterflowering honeysuckle makes an untidy bush in summer
suitable only for the outer garden." But what if you don't
have an outer garden? Have all these English garden griots
forgotten the oldest trompe l'oeil trick in their patron
saint Gertrude Jekyll's book -- re-flower an early-blooming
woody with a summer-flowering vine, say, clematis? The winter
honeysuckle is a handy free-form trellis for any upwardly
mobile clematis, such as the luminous Lanuginosa candida or
the fragrant pale lavender Betty Corning.
   Clearly, Americans are due a honeysuckle
consciousness-raising. Because I found that in the early '80s
even "The Essential Earthman" of Washington, D.C., Henry
Mitchell, had made some floral slurs on L. fragrantissima. He
allowed as how it does have "a truly ravishing scent" but
"not quite so sweet as to deserve `fragrantissima.' Surely
`fragrans' would have been sufficient," he sniffed. "They are
not ugly. On the other hand, they are not very beautiful,
either." Generously, he volunteered: "If for reasons peculiar
to yourself the shrub seems just wonderful in its beauty,
then of course you should grow it. But I was thinking of
normal gardeners." Wilting as I was under his phytoanalytic
attack, his final modest act of contrition barely registered:
"No need to lash the honeysuckle, of course. No plant is
perfect."
   Feeling like an abnormal, imperfect gardener misfit, I
trudged on reading honeysuckle put-downs. In 1983, Pamela
Harper, the well-known American garden photographer-writer,
depicted the winter honeysuckle as "a space-consuming,
graceless shrub with no beauty most of the year," belonging
to a family of "rather drab shrubs." At least Ms. Harper
conceded that "the abundant sweet-smelling, creamy white
flowers . . . are enough to justify its space."
   I was beginning to question my own plant judgment,
considering my unwavering devotion to winter honeysuckle the
past seven years. I mean, I had to dig back 60 years, to the
'20s and '30s, to find writers with any enthusiasm for the
plant. There was the estimable Louise Beebe Wilder, in the
"Early Scents" chapter of "The Fragrant Path," declaring: "If
I could have but half a dozen shrubs Lonicera fragrantissima
would without doubt be one of them." (Even Richardson Wright
admitted to his affection for the plant in a confession
entitled "Philandering in Bush Honeysuckles.") And in 1928,
the illustrious plant collector Ernest "Chinese" Wilson
included them in "More Aristocrats of the Garden,"
commenting: "For northern gardens there are no more beautiful
shrubs than some of the bush Honeysuckles."
   Amen. Late-20th-century plant snobs are dumping on a plant
that Robert Fortune, the Royal Horticultural Society's
collector in China during the 1840s, counted among "the most
beautiful plants of North China." L. fragrantissima was also
exceedingly valuable in the eyes of the RHS, which advised
Fortune that "the value of the plants diminishes as the heat
required to cultivate them is increased."
   Winter honeysuckle was among the 250 plants that Fortune
personally escorted on his voyage from China to England in
1845, when he became the first plant hunter to rely on the
Wardian case, a sort of traveling greenhouse. (The RHS had
instructed Fortune to "impress upon the minds of the Captains
the indispensable necessity of the glazed boxes being kept in
the light, on the poop if possible.") On the poop, Fortune
kept all but 35 of his Wardian wards alive. Indeed, many of
them (weigela, forsythia, viburnum, winter jasmine, bleeding
heart, balloon flower) are still alive in Occidental gardens.
   As you have guessed, I feel Fortune was acting for me in
bringing back winter honeysuckle on his slow boat from China.
This is one 19th-century Chinese plant introduction that
comes down to gardeners 147 years later with its
fragrantissima intact. That's more than can be said for most
of the hybrid descendants of that much more famous
19th-century Chinese plant immigrant, the tea rose. So L.
fragrantissima deserves a garden comeback, a nursery
rediscovery. Now is the time for independent-minded American
gardeners to do their bit toward sweetening the frigid air of
the season. Plant winter honeysuckle. We should all be
troweling toward the 150th anniversary of L. fragrantissima's
introduction. Gardeners interested in a 1995

FT  18 JAN 92 / Gardening: A window on winter's wonders - From his ivory
tower, Robin Lane Fox observes a sparkling display of cold-season blooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ARE in the middle of an extraordinary flowering which some of you may not
have noticed. This weekend, you have a chance to notice it, pleasurably.
Naturally, it has not escaped my ivory tower: how, indeed, could it?
Historians in ivory towers are so wonderfully broad-minded. They rise above
petty differences, the world is their horizon, and they look to and fro
behind the misty clouds of everyday life.
Or so it should be; but it is not because of these fine ideals that I have
noticed what is going on. The reason is that my view of it is very narrow.
Through two small windows of academic proportions, I look out on a cloud of
cherry blossom in January. Even a genius would probably not miss it but,
through these particular windows, it appears in an unintended light.
They are set in dark, damaged panelling which was stripped by two kind souls
last year in return for a modest bribe. After stripping it, they said they
ought to preserve it. This sounded sensible but took me by surprise when I
found they had painted it with a coat of transparent gloss. As a result, the
world outside is reflected in a mirror of dark, stained walls which gleam
like burnt toffee just removed from an oven.
Through these two toffee-brown mirrors, I keep up with the news of the
world. Empires collapse and so do heads of state at smart dinners. I see it
all, along with these clouds of blossom which hang on the air as if some
gentle person is breathing into a cold morning. From the front line, I can
report that it is a fabulous year for winter-flowering plants and that
winter-flowering cherry is having the time of its life.
Perhaps you mistrust the breadth of my narrow view: if so, you can verify it
today and tomorrow by a special trip to Hampshire. At Ampfield, near Romsey,
the Hillier Arboretum is marking the mild weather with a special weekend for
visitors.
The arboretum leaves happy memories in crazy weather. I will never forget a
strange day in March 1989 when the garden's gold magnolias beamed happily in
the sunshine before an audience of myself and some canny old-age pensioners.
Unless there has been a sudden frost in the small hours, you have a good
chance of an experience that will be just as memorable. The garden will be
open to visitors from 10.30 until dusk, charging Pounds 2 for admission.
Visitors ought to see why the winter-flowering cherry, Prunus subhirtella
autumnalis, remains my first choice among flowering trees for the garden,
the Glaxo of tree-planters during my adult lifetime. It will fit into front
gardens of modest size and it is a wonderful performer from an early age,
giving you quantities of buds which can be brought indoors.
This year, the sweet scent of the sarcoccas is all around; the viburnums are
fantastic, especially the white bodnamtense and its pink variant, Dawn,
which are showing more heads of peppery-sweet flowers than I can remember.
The winter suite is flowering crazily with that wonderful scent on those
pale yellow petals which look as if they, too, have been treated with
transparent gloss; while in one of its long borders, Hilliers has a
Himalayan honeysuckle, Lonicera setifera, which I have never seen before. It
also has bewitching witch hazels and some daphnes which need serious study.
In the family of witch hazels, I know what I like: my favourite is the pale
lemon-yellow form called pallida, but I suppose that this certainty needs to
be checked. Modern breeders have introduced shades of red, orange and copper
into the witch hazel's petals and my immediate response is to dislike all of
them when I see them on young plants.
They might, perhaps, look prettier at maturity but it takes so long for a
witch hazel to develop that I would not take the risk without hard evidence.
This weekend, hard evidence is available in the arboretum where some of
these hybrids have now grown into decent little trees and you can decide if
you really like a red variety called Diane or a copper-orange one called
Jelena. I much prefer the pale yellow, but all of them are scented
charmingly on a mild afternoon.
The winter-flowering daphnes will also be worth visiting. Some of them are
European natives but there are also some taller, pale-flowered varieties
which have a heavenly scent and are at home from India eastwards through
Katmandu to China.
Daphne bholua is the most tantalising and in the arboretum you will,
perhaps, see why daphne-fanciers have been excited. In Britain, the ordinary
form was never very hardy or free-flowering.
Instead, we needed to look for a named variety which had been collected by
keen botanists or found by sharp-eyed army colonels at a height in the
mountains where hardiness is more certain.
One of the best is a pink-flowered form called Gurkha, which was found by an
alert major in the field. The arboretum also has Jaqueline Postill, a deep
pink daphne which I have always envied but never pleased on a stony lime
soil.
The Cotswolds are not exactly Katmandu and witch hazels also dislike my part
of the country. Hence, the pleasure of a visit.
Go and see what you cannot grow, enjoying the second-hand gardening which
has always been a national pastime. Gardening, too, is a spectator sport and
there are certain things which are much too rare to be seen from a narrow
window.

FT  13 FEB 93 / Gardening: That old witch hazel magic - Hampshire's Hillier
Arboretum casts a fresh spell over Robin Lane Fox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN local authorities have a gardening budget, they usually make fools of
themselves: they put hanging baskets down old streets, chopped bark on
roundabouts, and trees at a density of five to the square metre. I am happy
to put the opposite case.
In 1977, Hampshire county council accepted responsibility for 160 acres of
trees, shrubs and mowing bequeathed to it by one of the kings among
nurserymen, HG Hillier. Nobody knew what would happen. Late in winter, you
might have expected hectares of heather and universal pansies. You would be
wrong.
I have just spent an afternoon walking around a pre-run of heaven, sustained
by council funds and a discreet balance of management. In two hours, I have
seen more flowers than I will have grown myself by mid-April.
If your spirits are low, head for Ampfield, near Romsey. In the Hillier
arboretum, camellias are open already beyond the lake; among the winter
honeysuckles, Lonicera setifera will test the experts; and you ought to be
in time for two extraordinary spectacles: a daphne from the Himalayas and
dozens of witch hazels shining like stars through the mist.
Since 1977, the council has not compromised or made the arboretum worse. It
has survived the storms and gained in height, maturity and coherence.
Harold Hillier had planned a certain amount and planted even more: like
Topsy, his arboretum just grew, and he probably did not think about the
width of a gang mower or every ultimate vista through the thujas. His
gardens had some firm, straight walks, a lovely lake, and raised beds of
gravel near the main house.
Design was only one consideration, though. The other was variety: as a
result, the garden now includes more than 100 of the champion trees in
Hampshire and over 100 listed rarities including one, a rather dismal
conifer, which is believed to be extinct in the wild.
The council's budget is well over six figures and supports 12 gardeners, a
distinguished curator, and the necessary work of clearing, inspiring and
opening up. The council can be proud of it and deserves a round of national
applause.
Hampshire head-scarves have a way of kidnapping the early places on the
arboretum's popular weekend workshops; but anyone can visit and you can
become a Friend for Pounds 10 a year. Meanwhile, visitors continue to pile
in, increasing as healthily as the birch trees.
Under the general slogan of education, the county must also reckon on quiet,
personal visits when somebody looks, thinks and decides to go away and
imitate. I sound confident about this aspect because it has happened to me
twice at this place.
Once was on a spring day three years ago when the magnolias opened all at
once and hundreds of Weekend FT readers set off to see them. The second was
the week before last when, admittedly, the arboretum committee gave me lunch
 -although I do not think the lunch was to blame.
Our tour was not a laid-back affair. It was the sort of afternoon when
angular figures in anoraks might ask if you thought a particular birch tree
was costata or ermanii and, if you were not sure, they would ask someone
else instead. There were no bimbettes, no rides on runabouts: just a covey
of gardeners and botanists, one woman in a mackintosh hat, and an inability
to stay in a bunch because our guides Roy, Chris and Tony kept finding
something more interesting about 50 yards away.
The point of the meeting was to view the collection of witch hazels and,
just to be sure, I had checked them before lunch. They are quite marvellous
and their flowers, like frost-proof strips of papery textile, ought to be
hanging on even now. The pale yellow forms have stood up best to the wet
winter and, anyway, I prefer them to the coppery reds and oranges with
bouncy, female names.
Most of this family spread widely - too widely for front gardens, when they
have to be pruned. In an arboretum, a Hamamelis can develop its full
stature. It can also show its full range, because new forms have been bred
from Belgium to America and you need to see a collection in order to
anticipate the best.
If you live on a soil without too much lime, try Hamamelis pallida, which is
an exquisite shade of lemon yellow; Sunburst, which has a tinge of green to
the lemon; or a dark yellow one called Vesna, which is remarkably scented
but has yet to make a mark in the trade. In Japan, these shrubs grow wild in
woodland clearings; and although they will survive and flower on lime, they
are much happier without it and also turn a better colour in autumn. If
money and supply were no object, I would choose Sunburst, while noticing
that Advent flowers very early and the self-explanatory Goldcrest much
later, extending the season through 2 1/2 months.
Witch hazels have nothing to do with witchcraft. Their name means flexible
or pliant and the only magic in them is their scent, which is strong on a
clear winter's day. Under council management they are a marvellous sight,
and perhaps it is enough to be able to visit them, even if you cannot grow
them. But there is something even better.
We had already admired a fine white Abeliophyllum from Korea and the
insiders were being matey with one of the under-gardeners. Turning left, I
entered another world. By a grass path stood an evergreen daphne, over 4ft
high and wide, smothered in scented flowers of a pale pink.
Sometimes, these close encounters make you want to turn a somersault. In
late winter, not far from the beastly old A31, here was a form of the
Nepalese daphne bholua, bursting in all directions with flowers of colour
and quality which I had never seen before.
There are other, rather sparse forms of this famous shrub from the Indian
continent, but this particular variety is highly personal to the arboretum.
Its parents were conveyed to Hillier by runners from the hills during a
visit to Nepal. Back in Hampshire, they set seed; and Alan Postill, a
sharp-eyed propagator on the nursery, noticed how some of the seedlings
looked better than others. He selected the best and called it Jacqueline
Postill, since when it has won many prizes including a First Class
Certificate.
Can you and I grow it? Opinions divide on its tastes and hardiness. Roy
Lancaster tells me that it needs a south or west wall, that it can be pruned
quite hard, but that it prefers little or no lime. The head gardener at the
arboretum thinks Roy might be wrong because he himself grows it on an open
slope of chalk above the centre of Winchester. Nonetheless, Roy thinks that
readers with lime in their garden should not expect miracles.
At present, I am inclined to follow the arboretum's head gardener, having
just seen a flourishing specimen on the alkaline rock garden at St John's
College in Oxford; whatever you might expect from that rock garden, it is
certainly not the sight of miracles. But daphne Jacqueline Postill is a
scarce plant at present, its price ranging between Pounds 16 and Pounds 25.
In mid-winter it is worth anything, not least a visit to Romsey.
Without the Hillier family, without Hampshire county council and without the
skill of the arboretum's staff, we would not have this extraordinary,
winter-flowering shrub for which our great-grandchildren will bless us.
Forget those grumbles about marigolds, begonias in baskets and
love-lies-bleeding on the roundabouts: in Hampshire, a council still knows
how to support the best in gardening.

FT  18 JAN 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week -(Hamamellis Mollis Pallida)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a variety of the Chinese witch hazel, one of the best of a small
genus of winter flowering deciduous shrubs. It starts to flower in December
and continues for many weeks as it is quite hardy, even the apparently
fragile flowers being undamaged by frost.
It differs from ordinary Hamamellis Mollis in having paler yellow, larger
flowers which make a better display. Both have a sweet scent which is
carried for a considerable distance on a still mild day. Like other species
of witch hazel it dislikes lime in the soil but is happy in neutral or
moderately acid soils not liable to dry out severely in summer. It makes a
big shrub which looks superficially like a hazel and the foliage colours
well before it falls in the autumn.
Some thinning of stems can be done in spring but care should be taken to
preserve the natural rather widely-branched character of the shrub.

honeysuckle is a handy free-form trellis for any upwardly
mobile clematis, such as the luminous Lanuginosa candida or
the fragrant pale lavender Betty Corning.
   Clearly, Americans are due a honeysuckle
consciousness-raising. Because I found that in the early '80s
even "The Essential Earthman" of Washington, D.C., Henry
Mitchell, had made some floral slurs on L. fragrantissima. He
allowed as how it does have "a truly ravishing scent" but
"not quite so sweet as to deserve `fragrantissima.' Surely
`fragrans' would have been sufficient," he sniffed. "They are
not ugly. On the other hand, they are not very beautiful,
either." Generously, he volunteered: "If for reasons peculiar
to yourself the shrub seems just wonderful in its beauty,
then of course you should grow it. But I was thinking of
normal gardeners." Wilting as I was under his phytoanalytic
attack, his final modest act of contrition barely registered:
"No need to lash the honeysuckle, of course. No plant is
perfect."
   Feeling like an abnormal, imperfect gardener misfit, I
trudged on reading honeysuckle put-downs. In 1983, Pamela
Harper, the well-known American garden photographer-writer,
depicted the winter honeysuckle as "a space-consuming,
graceless shrub with no beauty most of the year," belonging
to a family of "rather drab shrubs." At least Ms. Harper
conceded that "the abundant sweet-smelling, creamy white
flowers . . . are enough to justify its space."
   I was beginning to question my own plant judgment,
considering my unwavering devotion to winter honeysuckle the
past seven years. I mean, I had to dig back 60 years, to the
'20s and '30s, to find writers with any enthusiasm for the
plant. There was the estimable Louise Beebe Wilder, in the
"Early Scents" chapter of "The Fragrant Path," declaring: "If
I could have but half a dozen shrubs Lonicera fragrantissima
would without doubt be one of them." (Even Richardson Wright
admitted to his affection for the plant in a confession
entitled "Philandering in Bush Honeysuckles.") And in 1928,
the illustrious plant collector Ernest "Chinese" Wilson
included them in "More Aristocrats of the Garden,"
commenting: "For northern gardens there are no more beautiful
shrubs than some of the bush Honeysuckles."
   Amen. Late-20th-century plant snobs are dumping on a plant
that Robert Fortune, the Royal Horticultural Society's
collector in China during the 1840s, counted among "the most
beautiful plants of North China." L. fragrantissima was also
exceedingly valuable in the eyes of the RHS, which advised
Fortune that "the value of the plants diminishes as the heat
required to cultivate them is increased."
   Winter honeysuckle was among the 250 plants that Fortune
personally escorted on his voyage from China to England in
1845, when he became the first plant hunter to rely on the
Wardian case, a sort of traveling greenhouse. (The RHS had
instructed Fortune to "impress upon the minds of the Captains
the indispensable necessity of the glazed boxes being kept in
the light, on the poop if possible.") On the poop, Fortune
kept all but 35 of his Wardian wards alive. Indeed, many of
them (weigela, forsythia, viburnum, winter jasmine, bleeding
heart, balloon flower) are still alive in Occidental gardens.
   As you have guessed, I feel Fortune was acting for me in
bringing back winter honeysuckle on his slow boat from China.
This is one 19th-century Chinese plant introduction that
comes down to gardeners 147 years later with its
fragrantissima intact. That's more than can be said for most
of the hybrid descendants of that much more famous
19th-century Chinese plant immigrant, the tea rose. So L.
fragrantissima deserves a garden comeback, a nursery
rediscovery. Now is the time for independent-minded American
gardeners to do their bit toward sweetening the frigid air of
the season. Plant winter honeysuckle. We should all be
troweling toward the 150th anniversary of L. fragrantissima's
introduction. Gardeners interested in a 1995

NIGHT after night, artificially-keen weathermen have been telling us that it
will be warmer and wetter in the north. Down here in the south, frosts have
been sharper than we thought at first, and not every good plant has come
through unscathed. But what, I had been wondering, was the state of gardens
north of the border? To find out, I have been on a northern mission, not
expecting tropical forests but unsure whether snowdrops, for instance, would
yet be in flower.
I had intended this report to be controlled rigorously: aconites in
Motherwell, the first sign of bluebells in Dundee. It has gone off the
straight and narrow because I have been seduced. It might be the air or the
bottled water but, whenever I go to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh,
I lose my wits. I walk round in aimless circles for hours, like a spaniel
let out from a hot car.
Leave Kew to run its admission charges: in Edinburgh, entrance is still
free. It will soon be cheaper to take a coach pass up there to see what are
far-better gardens, anyway.
Signs of quality confront you immediately. Up the tarmac path to the main
entrance, there are two new beds of pernettyas, showing those dusky pink and
white berries which develop so prettily on lime-free soil. Inside, the light
falls magically on the pure white trunks of the eastern birches. Winter is
an excellent guide: its highlights are fewer and so it sets its own trail,
leading you from one to the next.
I could dwell on the many types of snowdrop, with names like Mighty Atom, in
bloom on Britain's finest rock garden. Pink and white flowers have declared
that the rhododendron season is open, not only on the mauve-pink praecox but
on the superior mucronolatum.
Below the new greenhouses, dozens of single pink flowers are already open on
a fine camellia called Bow Bells. Inside, there are clouds of pale-yellow
mimosa and some huge violet-blue flowers on the tibouchina, that lovely
Brazilian plant for a conservatory. The show of the month is called the Rain
Forest Experience, in which a thatched straw hut asks visitors to try to
forget they are under glass in Scotland. Prince Charles has written a letter
of support, but Rain Foresters will have to forgive me: the Alpine
Experience is very much better.
Beyond the Tropical Rock glasshouse, you can find a magical corner. Perhaps,
this weekend, there is a better one somewhere in an unknown garden but I
think I refuse to believe it. In my local botanic garden in Oxford, I have
been smiling contentedly at one good witch hazel and its gold-yellow
flowers. We are growing old together, but only one of us is improving with
age.
In Edinburgh, there is not one but a whole hamamelis corner, ranging from
the pale-yellow pallida to the dusky flavopurpurascens, which I have never
seen anywhere else. Their companions are as charming as their scent: half a
dozen varieties of winter-flowering viburnum in full beauty all over their
bare stems.
I have already decided on a swathe of viburnums under trees beside my house.
In Edinburgh, the sweetest form was unexpected to me: not Farreri or Dawn
but Charles Lamont. Naturally, it would not have been unexpected to Arthur
Hellyer, who has been writing about the forgotten importance of the Lamont
blood-line and the value of this variety. Naturally, too, he is right. The
Charles branch of the Lamont family is a generous performer with an aversion
to shady corners. He covers himself in the sweetest pink-white flowers.
Below the nearby wall, there are clumps of the palest Algerian iris, the
form called Walter Butt. A few yards away, there is another world in the
gardens' famous Alpine House. The mood changes with the season, but this
weekend it takes you to far finer worlds than a steamy rain forest. There
are pans of exceptional crocus, the big lilac-blue veluchensis and the
exquisite corsicus, the flowers of which are feathered with yellow and dark
streaks of a pale lavender.
Sub-species of wild cyclamen proliferate, from pink and white to rare
Turkish varieties. Special forms of corydalis are out in force; one of the
dionysias is covered with pale mauve flowers; you forget that it is still
winter as the entire corner around you seems to have jumped into spring.
Its leap has been helped by the usual scattering of plants which I have
never seen anywhere in the past 30 years. If you think that aconites are all
yellow, go and look at a rare Japanese variety, flowering its grey-lavender
head off in a pan in Edinburgh. Best of all, admire the small narcissi,
where the brightest is a lemon-yellow form in the Hooped Petticoat class
called Jenny Jane. The prettiest use for a cold greenhouse is to fill it
with alpine plants and bulbs which need no heating: Edinburgh will show you
how to do it.
For me, it is simply a visit to Heaven. The Edinburgh gardens could bemuse
you for half a lifetime, not least because there is one thing which the rest
of us have in plenty but, somehow, they seem to exclude. That something is
weeds - but it is hard to catch sight of any lying undisturbed among this
extraordinary collection of every sort of plant.

<LEADPARA>  CALIFORNIA'S shrinks must have an upsurge of clients this time every year:
Midwesterners and New Englanders coming in with their vague seasonal
depressions. Have the psychiatrists and psychologists identified their malady?
It's the nagging guilt of people who, on the one hand, rejoice as they send
their children out to trick-or-treat in flimsy tutus and papery pajamas and
yet, on the other hand, melt into puddles of unresolved mourning because
there's no frost on the punkin.;   Well, if shrinks haven't identified this
disorder, newspaper writers have. And much as I would like to avoid a cliched
introduction to this roundup of children's books about harvest time, I can't.
Too many of the nicest new books celebrate genuine "fodder in the shock"
autumns and sugar-maple locales -- and it seems impossible to write about them
without resorting to James Whitcomb Riley.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Arts &amp; Books  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A CORNUCOPIA OF HARVEST NOSTALGIA  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Muller, the book editor of the Mercury News, writes about children's books the
second Sunday of each month.; Children's Books  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     His almost-hopelessly dated dialect poem is nicely illustrated by Glenna
Lang in "When the Frost Is on the Punkin" (Godine, 30 pp., $15.95). Lang
portrays the "feller" who "a-feeling at his best . . . goes out to feed the
stock" as a pony-tailed girl in a lavender sweat suit. It's not
equal-pay-for-equal-work, but it's a little something to be thankful for.;
There's a Riley-like nostalgia in Laura Jane Coats' "The Almond Orchard"
(Macmillan, 32 pp., $14.95), but that's certainly not its main appeal. Coats,
a native Californian who lives in San Francisco, writes a richly detailed
account of almond harvests early in the century and now. The information is
set within a pencil-and-watercolor storybook about a girl who grows up
watching harvests that require lots of hand labor and who grows old in an era
when the harvest is almost completely mechanized.;   This is fascinating
stuff. Decades ago, workers spread tarps under the trees and then beat the
branches with long-handled rubber mallets to shake the nuts free. (Young men
got $1 a day to "knock almonds.") The tarps were then dragged to a shed where
the women removed the green hulls. The almonds were laid in the sun to dry,
raked often and then shoveled into bags. Horse-drawn wagons hauled the nuts to
the train, and the city.;   These days, a machine with spinning brushes like a
street sweeper's is driven up a tree. Huge metal fingers, like a tuning fork,
grasp the trunk and shake down an almond shower. A mechanical sweeper pushes
the almonds into rows that the mechanical pickup machine vacuums up. A
mechanical huller cleans the nuts before they go to a processing plant. The
nuts are shelled, and the shells burned to power the processing plant.;   The
harvest is the most interesting part of the book, but the whole almond life
cycle is represented. Almonds aren't a typical "crop" for books of this sort,
and the rural California-ness of this enterprise is also rare in children's
books. The dust jacket says that the little girl of the story is the author's
grandmother; we might hope that Coats' other grandmother cut 'cots as a girl,
or made date shakes at a roadside stand, or fed chicks in Petaluma.;   "Corn
Belt Harvest" by Raymond Bial (Houghton-Mifflin, 48 pp., $14.95) is a more
typical example of children's non-fiction: pitched to older kids, focused on a
mega-crop, written competently and illustrated with color photographs (and
grain doesn't come more picturesque than corn). It caught my eye mostly
because I'm a recovering Hoosier, but it would be a nice addition to any
school library. It's especially informative about grain elevators -- a
revelation to kids who know only the passenger kind.;   Field corn in full
Kodachrome is pretty bright, but "Corn Belt Harvest" is not the fall's most
colorful book. That honor would go to Lois Ehlert's "Red Leaf, Yellow Leaf"
(Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 36 pp., $14.95), an eye-dazzling example of this
popular collage artist's work. Ehlert, whose earlier books include "Color
Zoo," "Fish Eyes" and "Planting a Rainbow," tells the story of sugar maple
tree for little kids (and adds some text at the back for parents and older
siblings who want to read about how to plant a tree). The pleasure here is a
pure one -- color so vibrant it almost hums.;   The apotheosis of autumn and
harvest can be found in "Witch Hazel" (HarperCollins, 32 pp., $14.95), a book
that's wonderful in as many ways as there are pumpkin seeds in a Half Moon Bay
prize-winner. Hazel, a scarecrow made of two witch-hazel branches and an old
gingham dress, is created by Johnny to protect a struggling pumpkin vine.
Johnny, who appears to be motherless, is heir to all the wonderful old fairy
tales in which the third son triumphs. His two older brothers, though kind,
doubt his competence at every turn: He's always too little, too young, too
inexperienced. (There are echoes of a modern classic, too: "The Carrot Seed"
by Ruth Krauss and Crockett Johnson.);    As the older brothers get ready to
go to the Harvest Fair (Johnny can't go because they "won't be home 'til
morning"), they volunteer to try to sell the one small "one-pie" pumpkin he's
raised. Hazel, though she has not been scary enough to protect a whole crop,
has sheltered one pumpkin beneath her hem. Johnny shakes his head. "Hazel
saved the best one. It's not for sale." That night Johnny watches as Hazel
comes alive to hang the harvest moon.;   Author Alice Schertle writes this
magical story with just the right tone of understatement, and her dialogue
among the taciturn brothers is expert. Margot Tomes is the perfect
illustrator: Hazel, essentially faceless, manages to have a wide range of
expressions and a unique scarecrow grace. Tomes' palette is pleasing and
autumnal: colors that a Tweeds catalog might call cinnamon, ginger, russet,
tassel, milkweed, aubergine.;   In the poem I most love to recite to my
children (William Jay Smith's "A Pavane for the Nursery"), there's a line,
"I'll love you as long as the furrow the plow." Hazel gives Johnny that kind
of timeless love and gravity-certain comfort, and the children and parents who
meet them will share their joy. (box)  </TEXT>

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those of you with rivers at the bottom of the garden now have gardens at the
bottom of the river. I am treating these rains as a finale, atmospheric
applause for a previous year which gardeners, like investors, are unable to
reproach. From January to January, we have all had a marvellous run. The
winters never really froze; once again, the witch hazels are stupendous, my
young yew hedge still has a brown complaint which is undiagnosed; these
rains may be tiresome, but I am living on memories of a marvellous 1993.
The first half-year of English Gardens plc turned in results which no
watcher could have predicted. My highlights were endless, from January to
June. Winter daphnes took a new turn for me with the discovery that Daphne
Bholua Jacqueline Postill will grow and flower madly for all of us, even on
lime, if we give it a south or west wall.
In late spring, another new arrival, the blue Corydalis flexosa has
established itself as a gardener's dream in the various forms which emerged
less than 10 years ago from China: the prices are now coming down and this
long-flowering plant for slight shade is within reach of all of us in 1994.
Among older favourites, magnolias and camellias were marvellous and Indigo,
the darkest forget-me-not, reminded me that it is better, though smaller,
than all the others. In April, the sight of the best blue Echium, the one
called webbii, in Tresco Gardens reminded me that it is the best of these
tall, tender forms for frost-free expatriates in the south Mediterranean.
In May, I made a note to buy the white-flowered Staphylea colchica because
its showers of flower and easy disposition seem to be ignored by most keen
gardeners. The spring had remained extremely dry, and suddenly we were
plunged into an accelerated heaven.
In early June we had the display of a lifetime which rolled an English June
and July into one and will live in the memory of anyone who had brought
their garden-visiting forwards by three weeks. We had pink old-fashioned
roses among the salvias of mid-July and the paeonies of early June. Careful
colour-planning went marvellously by the board and all those artful
combinations were overtaken by nature's decision to let it all show at once.
The half-year ended with a climax of old roses, better than ever because
they flowered so profusely and were undamaged by rain while at their best.
As usual, I gave the highest mark to the silver pink Fantin Latour, the
essential variety for any garden, although it has usurped the name of the
great flower painter and its origin remains an unsolved mystery.
As Fantin faded, the rain began and the intermittent cold brought the year
back into balance. At half-time, the one cloud in the report was the
condition of summer bedding-plants and sweet peas, recovering from a dry
start to their year. Confounding the experts they then prospered in the
third quarter.
Summer retained its own magic, despite the rushed results. I fell for
Diascia Blackthorn Apricot, whose flowers have a pale colour of rare
intensity. We will be seeing it all over the place in 1994 and as a low
grower, it may be hardy, although this winter has not tested it. Buy it when
you see it, along with seeds of the white venidiums, as easy as weed from
Thompson and Morgan and agreed to be the bedding-plant of the year.
By September, nobody could say that the second half had lost the momentum of
the first. The Japanese Anemones proved equal to all the oddities of the
season, reminding me that we should all grow these easy plants and not be
deterred by their slowness to settle down in the first year.
We had a foretaste of rain, making bulb-planting an ordeal. Against the
odds, autumn colour then emerged from the gloom of October and gave us 10
days of astounding beauty. The beech trees were more brilliant than ever and
I started to notice the flowers which swept my personal prizes in this year
of extraordinary riches.
Why are so many of us wary or unaware of the Schizostylis, the Kafir Lily of
South Africa? Their rounded flowers come in shades of white, pale pink,
strong pink and red and their startling clarity persists into November when
this obliging year brought the yellow-flowered Mahonia Charity forward to
meet them.
For years, books have put me off this late-flowering family by saying that a
Schizostylis must have shade or slightly sheltered conditions. I have put
mine in sun for the hottest part of the day but they are thriving and
growing like mad because they have found a root-run under nearby paving
stones and are completely satisfied with the odd soaking.
Beside a path or in gaps on a terrace, these late, bright lily-flowers seem
to be wonderfully obliging. Experienced growers now tell me that they need
water early in the year, from December until May and that this dampness
matters more than shade or temperature.
As the rains fall, our national pursuit may be a wash-out, but I'm telling
myself that my Schizostylis are quietly loving every sodden minute of it.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Gardening: Green and pleasant gifts - Robin Lane Fox solves
present problems for the whole family with a trip to the nearest garden
centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If in doubt, give a gardener a gadget. If in funds, give yourself four of
the five new types of Christmas tree which have pushed prices up to Pounds 5
a foot.
If you are canny, however, you will know already that conventional Christmas
trees sell for Pounds 1.50 a foot deep in the country and that the prices
usually drop before the needles on Christmas Eve.
Personally, I would prefer to be given a plant. As presents, plants seem to
be socially unacceptable unless they are overheated house-plants which will
die by the end of January. Like dogs, hardy plants are not just for
Christmas. Unlike dogs, they improve the garden and can be left inside until
the weather improves.
Thanks to the better garden centres, plants look tempting in their close
season. Like good supermarkets, they show plants which look fresh and
worm-free and tempt customers who never go near open country. As a result,
you can now give them as presents without leaving earth on the carpet or
being unacceptably rustic.
This year, amazingly, you can even give hardy plants in flower. I have had a
fascinating time hunting through the centres and their main suppliers,
looking for hardy flowerers which are six months out of season.
Here are my top six, aimed at solving common family present problems and
priced from big suburban centres.
For Nigels and Tanias, who garden in shade in London and spend the summers
south of Florence, this year's answer is a camellia. Plants of the hardy
varieties are already flowering and I would opt for the double white 'Swan
Lake' which looks heavenly in a two-litre pot, even at Pounds 14.95.
For aunts and uncles on light soils in south-east England, I would
capitalise on the mild weather and choose the craziest sight of the year:
medium-sized plants of Ceanothus 'Gloire de Versailles', which have been
standing outdoors and flowering freely, four months after their season, at a
price of only Pounds 8.95.
Remind the Bernards and Catherines that these plants are hardy in most
winters, but not all, and that they might be better in a well-lit shed until
spring. They look lovely as a foil to old-fashioned roses if you prune them
gently in April to keep them at a height of about 5ft.
For Gill and Max, who have just settled in their home for life, choose a
long-term winter shrub and look no further than the witch hazels which
prefer neutral or acid soil and will improve with age. They, too, have been
flowering frantically to attract givers and, for Pounds 19.95, you can lose
your head with a full-flowering Hamamelis 'Pallida', whose pale yellow
flowers are the prettiest of the usual varieties.
Evergreens are their natural companions and need less of an explanation when
non-gardeners unwrap them - anyone can appreciate a good leaf. Some of the
bigger centres are stocking the cream-variegated form of Rhamnus, a great
favourite of mine against a south or west wall.
For Valerie and David, who open their gardens to the public, the best buys
on the circuit are fresh plants of the evergreen Osmanthus heterophyllus
'Variegatus', at Pounds 8.95. Garden centres can still surprise us all among
the usual range of mallows and buddleias: I have grown a plant of this
osmanthus with its mildly prickly evergreen leaves for the past 20 years. It
has moved homes with me, but it is still only 3ft high and wide. It is very
chic and striking and it has just flowered suddenly for the first time in
the mild November.
While planting out the forget-me-nots, I became aware of an exquisite scent
which traced back to the lines of tiny white flowers hanging from its
branches. It is the thinking person's alternative to yet more squares of
clipped green box.
I could never resist a viburnum, especially if I could not remember whether
Aunt Judith's soil in Wiltshire was acid or not. The winter varieties are
predictably good this week, but you can also find flowers on the
spring-flowering carlesii this week or on the bigger and stronger 'Park Farm
Hybrid'.
When there are still flowers all over the place I have less time for those
centres which are trying to sell callicarpas with violet-mauve fruits by
calling them 'Beauty Berries' and pricing them at Pounds 24.95 each. The
small print tells you that you need a group of three in order to be sure of
a proper crop.
Instead, I would go for a yellow-berried cotoneaster which is excellent up
any great-uncle Edward's drainpipe, even in semi-shade. 'Expery' or
'Rothschild' are the best varieties. You can still find plants with yellow
berries untouched at 'only' Pounds 8.95.
What about those difficult people, young couples who have nothing but
principles and mean, for the moment, to stay together for years, or
open-handed people who have so much more money than you and may well try to
humiliate you by dishing out a crate of champagne?
Outflank the young Simons and Kirstys by giving them the nucleus of their
fruitcage for the future. This year, the blackcurrant bushes are looking
eminently unwrappable because they are thick with buds, though still without
leaves.
'Baldwin' is a sound, later-cropping variety which will be at its best when
the superstores have moved on through the calendar and are trying to sell
you loganberries instead.
The champagne Charlies need more generous treatment. Do not be stampeded
into buying the neatly-clipped standard of evergreen privet or bay at Pounds
70 because it looks fancy: you could grow one yourself for very much less
and they look better in pairs, increasing the bill. Instead, go for
unarguable quality which even the idlest garden-watcher will know how to
pronounce.
This week, there are super magnolias, looking large, clean and advanced in
bud. Big bushes of Magnolia alba superba range from Pounds 14.95 to Pounds
49 for extravagant specimens, 4ft high and wide. The rustica rubra form of
this variety can be found at even greater sizes, up to Pounds 70. My
personal choice would have to be Magnolia loebneri 'Leonard Messel',
root-wrapped in hessian and about 4ft high at a cool Pounds 69, complete
with dozens of visible buds.
These large magnolias will transplant easily into gardens so long as you
water them over a dry spring and early summer. After five years, smaller
sensible transplants will probably have overtaken them, but Christmas is not
a time for being sensible.
If you are wondering how to measure up to a millionaire's fire-power, enlist
a magnolia's flower-power and be fairly sure that she will not know what it
really costs.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Gardening: Green and pleasant gifts - Robin Lane Fox solves
present problems for the whole family with a trip to the nearest garden
centre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
If in doubt, give a gardener a gadget. If in funds, give yourself four of
the five new types of Christmas tree which have pushed prices up to Pounds 5
a foot.
If you are canny, however, you will know already that conventional Christmas
trees sell for Pounds 1.50 a foot deep in the country and that the prices
usually drop before the needles on Christmas Eve.
Personally, I would prefer to be given a plant. As presents, plants seem to
be socially unacceptable unless they are overheated house-plants which will
die by the end of January. Like dogs, hardy plants are not just for
Christmas. Unlike dogs, they improve the garden and can be left inside until
the weather improves.
Thanks to the better garden centres, plants look tempting in their close
season. Like good supermarkets, they show plants which look fresh and
worm-free and tempt customers who never go near open country. As a result,
you can now give them as presents without leaving earth on the carpet or
being unacceptably rustic.
This year, amazingly, you can even give hardy plants in flower. I have had a
fascinating time hunting through the centres and their main suppliers,
looking for hardy flowerers which are six months out of season.
Here are my top six, aimed at solving common family present problems and
priced from big suburban centres.
For Nigels and Tanias, who garden in shade in London and spend the summers
south of Florence, this year's answer is a camellia. Plants of the hardy
varieties are already flowering and I would opt for the double white 'Swan
Lake' which looks heavenly in a two-litre pot, even at Pounds 14.95.
For aunts and uncles on light soils in south-east England, I would
capitalise on the mild weather and choose the craziest sight of the year:
medium-sized plants of Ceanothus 'Gloire de Versailles', which have been
standing outdoors and flowering freely, four months after their season, at a
price of only Pounds 8.95.
Remind the Bernards and Catherines that these plants are hardy in most
winters, but not all, and that they might be better in a well-lit shed until
spring. They look lovely as a foil to old-fashioned roses if you prune them
gently in April to keep them at a height of about 5ft.
For Gill and Max, who have just settled in their home for life, choose a
long-term winter shrub and look no further than the witch hazels which
prefer neutral or acid soil and will improve with age. They, too, have been
flowering frantically to attract givers and, for Pounds 19.95, you can lose
your head with a full-flowering Hamamelis 'Pallida', whose pale yellow
flowers are the prettiest of the usual varieties.
Evergreens are their natural companions and need less of an explanation when
non-gardeners unwrap them - anyone can appreciate a good leaf. Some of the
bigger centres are stocking the cream-variegated form of Rhamnus, a great
favourite of mine against a south or west wall.
For Valerie and David, who open their gardens to the public, the best buys
on the circuit are fresh plants of the evergreen Osmanthus heterophyllus
'Variegatus', at Pounds 8.95. Garden centres can still surprise us all among
the usual range of mallows and buddleias: I have grown a plant of this
osmanthus with its mildly prickly evergreen leaves for the past 20 years. It
has moved homes with me, but it is still only 3ft high and wide. It is very
chic and striking and it has just flowered suddenly for the first time in
the mild November.
While planting out the forget-me-nots, I became aware of an exquisite scent
which traced back to the lines of tiny white flowers hanging from its
branches. It is the thinking person's alternative to yet more squares of
clipped green box.
I could never resist a viburnum, especially if I could not remember whether
Aunt Judith's soil in Wiltshire was acid or not. The winter varieties are
predictably good this week, but you can also find flowers on the
spring-flowering carlesii this week or on the bigger and stronger 'Park Farm
Hybrid'.
When there are still flowers all over the place I have less time for those
centres which are trying to sell callicarpas with violet-mauve fruits by
calling them 'Beauty Berries' and pricing them at Pounds 24.95 each. The
small print tells you that you need a group of three in order to be sure of
a proper crop.
Instead, I would go for a yellow-berried cotoneaster which is excellent up
any great-uncle Edward's drainpipe, even in semi-shade. 'Expery' or
'Rothschild' are the best varieties. You can still find plants with yellow
berries untouched at 'only' Pounds 8.95.
What about those difficult people, young couples who have nothing but
principles and mean, for the moment, to stay together for years, or
open-handed people who have so much more money than you and may well try to
humiliate you by dishing out a crate of champagne?
Outflank the young Simons and Kirstys by giving them the nucleus of their
fruitcage for the future. This year, the blackcurrant bushes are looking
eminently unwrappable because they are thick with buds, though still without
leaves.
'Baldwin' is a sound, later-cropping variety which will be at its best when
the superstores have moved on through the calendar and are trying to sell
you loganberries instead.
The champagne Charlies need more generous treatment. Do not be stampeded
into buying the neatly-clipped standard of evergreen privet or bay at Pounds
70 because it looks fancy: you could grow one yourself for very much less
and they look better in pairs, increasing the bill. Instead, go for
unarguable quality which even the idlest garden-watcher will know how to
pronounce.
This week, there are super magnolias, looking large, clean and advanced in
bud. Big bushes of Magnolia alba superba range from Pounds 14.95 to Pounds
49 for extravagant specimens, 4ft high and wide. The rustica rubra form of
this variety can be found at even greater sizes, up to Pounds 70. My
personal choice would have to be Magnolia loebneri 'Leonard Messel',
root-wrapped in hessian and about 4ft high at a cool Pounds 69, complete
with dozens of visible buds.
These large magnolias will transplant easily into gardens so long as you
water them over a dry spring and early summer. After five years, smaller
sensible transplants will probably have overtaken them, but Christmas is not
a time for being sensible.
If you are wondering how to measure up to a millionaire's fire-power, enlist
a magnolia's flower-power and be fairly sure that she will not know what it
really costs.

<HEAD>$1.3 Million Lotto Ticket Found in Cookie Jar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Newton Hazell looked on his dresser, in his desk
drawers and under his mattress before he remembered the cookie jar
_ which was where he'd unknowingly stuffed a $1.3 million winning
Lotto ticket last year.
   ``I just stuck it in and forgot all about it,'' said Hazell, who
overcame the memory lapse to become a millionaire just four days
before his ticket would have become worthless.
   Hazell, a correction officer, showed up Wednesday at the lottery
offices to collect his prize from the Oct. 22, 1988, drawing.
   ``Isn't that something? This was down to the nitty-gritty.
Another week and I would have lost it,'' said Hazell, of Metuchen,
N.J., after a Thursday news conference announcing his sweet find.
   Hazell, 58, bought the winning ticket at the Towne and Country
Deli on New York City's Staten Island, selecting the numbers 7, 9,
13, 21, 34 and 43. But he dumped the ticket into the cookie jar and
never checked to see if he won.
   Last week, Hazell noticed a sign in the deli telling Lotto
players to check their tickets because a $1.3 million prize was
still unclaimed. A newspaper article pinned next to it showed the
missing ticket contained his weekly numbers.
   ``I looked everywhere, because I saw my numbers. I went through
dressers, drawers, under the mattress. I went through a bag where I
throw all my losing tickets,'' said Hazell.
   Finally, he had a feeling about the cookie jar and went to check
it out: ``There it was, all by itself.'' Winners have one year to
produce their tickets; Hazell showed up with just four days to
spare.
   State lottery spokesman Bill Knowlton said this was the longest
anybody had ever waited to claim a prize. Two other people picked
winning numbers in the drawing, and both had already claimed their
shares of the $4 million jackpot.
   Hazell _ whose winning numbers combined his birthday,
anniversary, daughter's age and license plate number _ said the
windfall won't have any immediate effect on his lifestyle.
   ``I'm not going to retire. I'm a young 58, going on 25,'' he
said.

   Newton Hazell found the sweetest treat of all at
the bottom of his cookie jar _ a long-forgotten lottery ticket
worth $1.3 million that would have become worthless just four days
later.
   ``Isn't that something? This was down to the nitty gritty.
Another week and I would have lost it,'' the Metuchen, N.J.,
correction officer said Thursday.
   Hazell, 58, bought the New York Lotto ticket for the Oct. 22,

same numbers he picks every week _ 7, 9, 13, 21, 34 and 43. He
dumped the ticket into his cookie jar at home and never checked to
see if he won.
   ``I just stuck it in and forgot all about it,'' said Hazell, who
works at the Arthur Kill Correctional Facility on Staten Island.
   Last week, Hazell was back in the deli when he noticed a sign
encouraging Lotto players to check their tickets because a $1.3
million prize was still unclaimed. A newspaper story pinned next to
the sign showed the missing ticket contained his numbers. That's
when Hazell began to search.
   ``I looked everywhere, because I saw my numbers. I went through

know if I'm a celebrity or not.''

FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: Hazel coppice grows anew - Country view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No-one knows how many coppice workers there were in the UK before the second
world war. But in 1956 there were only 300 and their numbers have steadily
decreased, said Hampshire county council countryside officer Jonathan Howe.
In Hampshire, however, the trend has been reversed. Howe says that 70 of the
190 full-time coppice workers in England and Wales work in his county. His
team is reviving this ancient rural industry based on hazel, a species that,
with oak, ash and yew, was viewed as a chieftain among trees in Celtic
times.
Hazel coppicing declined in the mid-19th century, pushed out by the millions
of oaks planted to supply the expanding tanning and shipbuilding industries.
It nearly died out after the second world war and the agricultural manpower
crisis it brought. Since then much coppice has been bulldozed or poisoned,
at first for agricultural purposes, then to make room for conifer
plantations.
The backbone of the revival in Hampshire has been the thatching industry and
a renewed interest in hurdles for garden fences and outdoor screens.
'The industry has attracted new entrants in the last few years, and though
some of the thatching spar makers have gone out of business with the general
decline in the building trade, many have become hurdlemakers,' said Howe.
'Hurdlemaking is really picking up after the years of recession. People are
realising that a good hazel hurdle should last 15 years - longer than its
rival willow.'
Each year Howe and his team attempt to bring 300-400 acres of coppice
woodland back into rotation. They clear derelict coppice wood, replanting
when necessary, and thin the taller, slower-growing deciduous trees.
This is the busiest time of the year for the coppice worker. Most of the
cutting is done between February and late April. Hazel rods cut at this time
are sappy and usable for several months.
Spring cutting also brings a bonus for the flora. 'The bluebell wood evolved
under traditional coppice management,' said Howe. 'This country is the best
in Europe for bluebells, which thrive in our oceanic climate,' said Howe.
'Violets, primroses and wood anemonies also thrive under the coppice system.
They have lots of sunlight for two to three years. Then all is shade for the
next few years until the coppice is cut. The alternative - the high forest
system - kills off their abundance. Under this system there is a wonderful
flush of flowers for two to three years, then as the conifers grow all
becomes dark for 60 years.'
After cutting, the hazel stools are left for seven to 10 years. 'After this
time an acre of well-stocked hazel will produce 10,000 to 12,000 rods 10 ft
to 15 ft in length,' Howe said.
Hazel rods are ideal for pea and bean sticks. They are also used in river
bank protection, using the traditional 'spiling' method - woven round wooden
stakes. Curled hazel shavings are used in potpourri.
'We are developing new hazel products such as dog kennels, tree guards, rose
arches, bowers, framed gates and bird hides,' Howe said. 'We are also
attempting to bring coppice wood into the home once more. In the past it was
not only used as the framework inside wattle and daub panels, but also for
furniture. We are encouraging one or two designers to experiment with woven
hazel panels in chairs and blanket boxes.' Details of the Hampshire coppice:

FT  04 JUN 94 / Outdoors: Here is the weather flowercast . . . - Gardening /
How ordinary garden blooms may be an indicator of climatic changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN ALDRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story of the British climate is written in the nation's flower beds,
according to Fred Last, honorary professor of forestry and natural resources
at Edinburgh University. He believes the UK's parks and back gardens could
be used as early indicators of such climate changes as global warming.
Botany and meteorology have come together in Last's own garden in East
Lothian. It was pressed into service as a weather station in 1977 when he
decided to explore the impact of the previous year's drought on plants and
realised there was no bench mark for his observations.
Records of the flowering dates of plants all over Britain had been kept
between 1891 and 1945, but no one had analysed the data to see if it had a
story to tell about climate. So Last decided to use his garden to build a
definitive picture of how plants respond to their environment over time.
Since 1977, he has recorded the flowering date of every species in the
garden. At present, there are 450, of which 250 have been there since the
start.
The records show that some species - such as honesty, lilac and apple -
bloom on the same day every year. Indeed, the archives at Covent Garden (the
London fruit and vegetable market) show that home-grown apples have been
reaching the market on virtually the same date for more than a century. But
the flowering dates of many other species - such as grape hyacinths,
rhododendrons and roses - appear to be dictated by temperatures in the
months before blooming.
Using average flowering dates for the period from 1978 to 1988, Last has
been able to show that warm years such as 1988 and 1989 were registered by
changes in flowering dates. 'Maximum and minimum temperatures were both four
degrees higher than average in January and February 1989, and this resulted
in a total change in flowering patterns in the garden,' he says. 'By March,
there were three times more plants in bloom than normal, and the flowering
of sensitive species such as poached egg plant and rhododendron were
advanced by several weeks.'
These species flowered early in 1990, too. But the trend was not sustained
and 1991 saw the return of average flowering patterns. This season has seen
few highlights so far - at least in East Lothian.
While November and December were unusually cool, temperatures were normal
thereafter and the number of flowers in bloom from January to March
reflected this, being close to the long-term average. People thought it was
a cold winter, but the message from the flower beds is that while it was
long, it was not exceptionally hard.
Put simply, most sensitive species respond to air and soil temperatures a
month or so before flowering. Some also are moisture-sensitive, while roses
seem to respond to cumulative effects - two warm years such as 1988 and 1989
saw them flowering even earlier in 1990.
Plants which are not climate-sensitive are said to be photoperiodic - their
flowering triggered only by the length of the day. The underlying reasons
for these differing responses remain unknown but Last hopes his garden-based
studies might trigger more research into the basic biology of flowering.
These trends have obvious implications for garden design. A year-round show
could be guaranteed by mixing plants which unfold their flowers in an
orderly progression as the days lengthen, with those which are
climate-responsive; this would add interest and variability.
Bulbs, for instance, could include temperature-responsive snowflakes and
fritillaries alongside the yellow and white tulipa tarda, which is
photo-periodic. For the rock garden, saxifrage will bloom early or late
against a constant background of yellow alyssum. Photo-periodic shrubs
include the pink and white-flowered escallonia, while the buddleia (known as
the orange ball tree) is a climate responder.
As far as climate goes, it is still too soon to say if the trends of the
past few years amount to global warming. 'People thought that the warmth of
1988 and 1989 was bound to have a residual effect,' says Last.
'The fact that we were back to normal by 1991 suggests that those years may
have been part of a short-term trend. But with many more years of
monitoring, we will certainly pick up the longer term climate trends.'
Last would like to see climate change gardens used in a serious scientific
context - in schools, or attached to meteorological stations. At present, he
is designing a climate change garden for the Centre for Deep Sea
Oceanography, in Southampton.
The scientists there are looking at how the oceans act as a 'sink' for
carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by anthropogenic emissions such
as power stations and car exhaust fumes. 'It's particularly appropriate to
have a climate change garden at a site where they're studying the effect of
climate on the ocean,' Last says.
Violet willow, witch hazel and lily of the valley are among the
photo-periodic responders which will provide constant and predictable
year-round colour for the scientists. Mexican orange blossom, blue-eyed
Mary, and Solomon's seal will work alongside them as early indicators of
climate change - as could many of the plants in gardens up and down the
country.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Gardening: The idiocy of planting for ethnic correctness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF you may be looking forward to planting trees during the next few
months. You are interested not only in the 'best tree for a small garden,'
that elusive entity which obsesses books on gardening. You also want trees
for a field, an acreage of set-aside, or an eventual barrier in the
landscape.
If you want inspiration, look around you this weekend or visit a local
arboretum. The autumn colour is still holding up well, from Westonbirt to
Leonardslee. You have your last chance to weigh-up your options while the
leaves are looking their best.
Our choices are muddled with incoherent rhetoric which seems to be gaining
ground. It comes home to me whenever I look through the two main windows of
my life. One, the home window, is evidence of mistakes made 25 years ago by
somebody else; the other, the working window, reveals the options which
ought to have been followed.
The home window looks out across my garden into a tall boundary fence of
sycamores, the rock-bottom trees of British landscaping. Whatever you decide
after reading this, I do beg you not to plant them. By late summer, the
leaves are already dull and dirty; in autumn, they turn a soulless
grey-brown and are slow to rot when they drop.
The main reason they crop up so often in former owners' gardens is that they
seed themselves frantically and some of the seedlings turn into trees.
Nobody in their right mind would allow these seeding menaces anywhere near
their flower beds. But free-seeding trees appeal to ecological gardeners:
they can be introduced 'naturally' and, after years of seeding, they have
become so firmly established that they satisfy hedgers and foresters who
want to go 'native.'
Going native has become extraordinarily acceptable. County councils have
special grants for amenity tree-planters, who are so slow to claim them that
even a casual inquiry encourages a deluge of correspondence and offers of a
consultative visit. The grants have two conditions: the trees must be open
to public viewing, a reasonable condition as they are planted on public
money, but they must also be 'native broad-leaves.'
This second condition is ridiculous. Nobody will give me a grant if I plant
a glorious grove of ginkgos or an avenue of tulip trees which are
beautifully foreign. If I propose sycamores, I would qualify for a
broad-leaved handout. It seems batty to me. The council would probably be
asked to prosecute me for discrimination if I banned immigrants in any other
area of life; why does it give grants only to planters who conform to ethnic
correctness?
The notion is ultimately bogus, anyway. When does a tree become a native,
not an import: what about wild cherries or walnuts, both of which are
approved native broad-leaves but which historians have sometimes proposed as
foreign imports, brought to Britain by the Romans?
Why should we want a tree just because it is indigenous? Large areas of
'indigenous' British life are pretty second-rate. I would ban subsidies for
sycamores and point out to inquirers that there are far lovelier trees for
Britain than the service tree, hawthorn, common crab and elder which make up
a municipally-correct idea of a 'native hedging mix.'
Avoid sycamores, therefore, and do not fall for the mindless 'native'
rhetoric. Turn instead to the view from my life's other window, out beyond
the shoulders of pupils reading essays on classical slavery to a wonderful
harmony of winter-flowering cherry, non-copper beech, extraordinarily
foreign mulberry, and Oriental wistarias which are still retaining their
green leaves before going yellow in a blaze.
Here, natives mercifully are swamped by immigrants. While sycamores were
being planted in the sight-line of one of my windows, a connoisseur was
planting these un-English trees in front of the other. I wish I could risk
felling the boundary hedge and replace it with trees from the tutorial
vista, jazzed up by the best aliens which I could foist on the West
Oxfordshire council.
Like our restaurants, our hedges need to be rescued from 'native' staples.
We also need to break down the categories. When we think of the landscape,
we are still too ready to divide trees into 'specimen' or 'hedgerow'
varieties and to mark off some of them as 'ornamentals.' Fields and
set-aside, we seem to be saying, do not need ornamentals: huge, sweet
chestnuts, white-flowering winter cherry, Chinese sorbus, brilliant
parrotias or the best birches. No, they need the unspeakably British service
tree and the miserable blackthorn.
Even when we do dare to be ornamental, we run in ruts. Outside the garden,
birches still amount to the pock-marked trunks of a common silver birch, not
the stunningly white Betula jacquemontii. In fields, limes are large-leaved
limes, not the silver or weeping silver varieties.
I am not claiming that cities have broader horizons. From New York to Seoul,
streets are about to glow with the autumn duty of yellowing ginkgo trees:
why did British town councils miss out on this lovely possibility, planting
those awful yellow-edged acers on a main route into Leicester or splodges of
pink cherry when the A23 pauses for a tree?
We used to be told that street trees had to be chosen so as to be
vandal-proof: I never understood why a dreary mountain ash was any more
proofed than one of its Oriental relations. In fields and on farms, we were
also told that native trees were the right choice because they were better
at fighting for themselves.
Chemicals and machinery have reduced the force of these arguments. Our new
age of weed-killers, based on glyphosate, allow us to keep grass and coarse
weeds away from a newly-planted tree on a headland as easily as in a garden:
two or three sprays during the year will keep it clear without much
difficulty. As a result, we can risk so-called ornamentals in places where
once they might have succumbed to weeds.
We can also risk more of them at a greater height. The books still tell us
to transplant some of the better varieties as pot-grown specimens, about 2
ft high, because they will then take root. But better techniques of root
preparation and better machinery for lifting has made this advice outdated
in most cases.
You can now buy most of these trees at a height where you will not lose them
in the first year among your patch of weeds, set aside and subsidised by the
EC.
I buy my trees from the fairly-priced list of Landford Trees, Landford,
Salisbury, Wiltshire. Its ginkgos are Pounds 11.50 each (plus VAT) per 10 at
six to seven feet high, while Sweet Chestnuts are Pounds 9.25 at 8-10 ft and
tulip trees are Pounds 14.25 at a similar height.
Early in the 18th century, the great landscape architect, William Kent, was
said 'to have first jumped the fence and seen all nature was a garden.'
Nowadays, I merely suggest that we remember the full width of nature,
outside the British Isles, and then proceed accordingly.
Of course, we do not want anything too fancy or too variegated or too purple
and gold in the setting of farmland. But there is no fixed rule that woods
in Britain have to be beeches and copses have to major on hazels. Open out,
survey the world and enhance the view from your windows of the future.

In a sudden leap, there are flowers again, a wonderful prelude to the
unpredictable dance which the seasons now work for us all.
Last week, there seemed to be nothing; then, on Saturday, there were
hundreds of crocuses wrapped like yellow pencils; on Sunday, there were
aconites in churchyards and on Monday, snowdrops were spattering the ground
once more.
We are a month ahead of schedule, while the last of the winter's roses are
still waiting to leave the stage and their green leaves make a curious
backdrop to a new year. After weeks of gloomy rain, these early visitors
stand out like drops of sunshine.
They remind me that it is time for gardeners to get moving. Before they
start, they will need little reminding that their art is never cheap.
Mirrored in our gardens' microcosm, all economic life is reflected. Once
upon a time, we used to supply ourselves, grow our own plants and pay people
to help us look after them. Since the 1970s, the trade has changed as
rapidly as anything in business life.
Consumers want different things: busy householders will pay for shops to
display plants for immediate sale; garden centres have multiplied and keen,
fresh stock has become the cult of the visiting public.
With their usual subtlety, sellers have traded on their two best human
allies, impulse and impatience. Why wait for years when money can buy you a
plant which already looks reassuringly bigger than other people's? If you
like it, take it away in the car boot.
Here, technology has come to the rescue. In this new age of polythene,
plants can be turned out of their plastic containers at almost any season:
they can also be moved from one country to another. At this point, the
question of the economy and its prospects confront us all through a twist in
our national idea of ourselves.
We all know the stereotype: British goods may be declining; the monarchy may
be intercepted on the wrong frequency, but at least we Brits know how to
garden and our gardening is the envy of Europe. Tourist boards promote it;
even the French have to admit that it is better than theirs; economists
sometimes blame it for other sins.
I have sometimes been told by serious pundits that a reason why British
industry is losing its competitive edge is that employees are more
interested in their gardens and that the managers are waiting every day to
get back to the roses or the real business of life, so amply covered in the
Weekend FT.
Nobody could dispute the art of our flower gardens at their best or the
widespread love of gardening, planting and growing. However, I do think that
the better examples are rather rare and that visually, much of our gardening
(including bits of mine) is engagingly awful.
I do also notice how this national art is called 'English gardening', as if
nothing of any significance happened on the Celtic fringe. If I had to
choose only one public garden in the kingdom, it would always be the
Edinburgh Botanic Garden, but perhaps it is too Olympian to object to the
English insult.
What does amuse me, and in future may alarm me, is that the backbone of the
best garden centres, many of our nurseries and our garden landscaping is not
actually grown in England or even in Britain. Dreamy English gardening is
all very well in a summer's haze, but many of its greatest nurseries buy the
plants for it in the Netherlands and Belgium.
You can see why this piece of national double-think will soon have economic
consequences. Personally, I will rely ever more on seeds. But the irony is
not going to disappear quietly or without cost.
Of course there are planty 'people' all over Britain with their own cottage
industries and home-grown lists of lesser-known specimens. Yet they cannot
supply the trade with much of its better shrubs, hedging plants, bulbs and
border plants because they do not specialise or grow to the right scale
perhaps, or, to be charitable, have such a good European soil. Whenever you
see a particularly big and seductive plant in the garden centre, it is
highly likely to have been imported from a Dutchman or a Belgian who would
not know how to pronounce Miss Jekyll's name.
This nice little irony prompts me to two conclusions, one of which is
analytic, the other is commonsense. Like machine tools, the plants for
Englishpersons' gardens are now being imported en masse from abroad.
Many argue that Britain would have a bright economic future in heavy
industry if only engineering was part of our daily culture. Those people
ought to stop and consider the case of gardening. Gardening is agreed to be
not just a cultural taste but a national obsession: nonetheless, our big
traders and designers have to import a mass of its basic materials because
their obsessive nationals cannot grow it for themselves.
My second conclusion is simply prudential. Now that so many retail sources
are depending on plants from Europe, their cost is not exactly going to obey
the chancellor's happy predictions while the currency is suffering from
wilt. Flower bulbs have already made a nonsense of the retail index because
most of them come in from the Netherlands and this season's summer lilies,
hyacinths and gladioli have had surcharges of 15 per cent or more imposed on
them.
Matters have not been helped by an awkward season in 1992 for many of the
maincrop bulbs in which the Dutch, especially, excel. As for evergreen yew,
box and well-grown specialities such as viburnum or witch hazel, the same
price rises will soon apply wherever the retail trade has grown to depend on
foreign stock.
The moral, therefore, is to swap impatience for self-sufficiency and start
to grow as much as possible from seeds from one's own garden and seed lists.
The choice of seeds is one of the pleasures of late January and next week, I
will be scanning for a short list. This year, however, it has an extra
economic thrust.
I have already pre-booked my seeds of regale lilies, white galtonias and
mixed agapanthus. I have opted for patience with the late-flowering
lespedeza whose silky leaves and rose-purple flowers are such a blessing in
autumn and I will be trying for half-hardy daturas from seed. Anything the
Dutch can do I can surely do half as well: from a seed packet, you always
raise more than you need, with a margin of error which allows even an
Englishman without illusions to compete.

FT  21 AUG 93 / Gardening: Climbers which make an impression
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THIS sudden week of heavenly weather, an image of the painter Monet keeps
returning to my mind. At this moment, the nasturtiums must be flowering
along the path of his garden at Giverny, in France, recently recreated for
visitors. Perhaps there are still some water lilies, and possibly the
agapanthus are as good as mine and almost as good as the most valuable
agapanthus in the world, which Monet painted in his 80s and which now hangs
in the basement of the Marmottan in Paris.
It is not for these reasons, however, that I am thinking of him. He used to
say that nothing else in the world interested him except his painting and
his flowers. I have moments of envying his nerve in saying this, and rather
more moments of reminding myself why I disagree. Then, I look at the
newly-built arches in my garden and picture him again, the patron saint of
arch-building, which has continued to be a craze after his death.
At Giverny, above the nasturtiums, the managers have reinstated wide arches
for their roses (the colours of some are better than others). Monet himself
first added these arches to his garden's metalwork in 1891 when he was 51. I
am pleased to discover that he painted them a bright and leafy shade of
green. My arch-builder painted mine in my absence and did not forewarn me
that he was thinking on Monet-coloured lines. I had expected something
darker, but the grass-green is already fading gently and I can tell myself
that I now have a true Impressionist colour, chosen carefully for all
Monet's arches, shutters and woodwork.
Nowadays, many companies will sell you arches in sections and some will even
send adequate notes on how to assemble them. I have always found it cheaper
to hire a local blacksmith and buy any materials from him. I have also hired
a friend's trained metalworker, who saved me the aggravation of erecting an
Agriframe and put up my arches instead.
They went up in June and I think they are the reason non-gardeners are so
sure that, this year, the garden has taken a great leap forward. Quietly,
they have been waiting for me to go Sloane. They would be even more
impressed if only I could decide what to put on them.
Sometimes, readers send me a good idea: you first sent me the
yellow-flowered clematis for the hot south wall and the best red rose,
Etoile de Hollande, for a wall facing east. We all know about arches of
laburnum, which look spectacular if you use the vossii variety. We also know
about wisteria, and it is now worth studying The Plant Finder for the best
whites, the Chinese form called Caroline, Black Dragon, and the others which
I used to think had disappeared. I find that the lovely Multijuga variety is
too much on a normal arch because its wonderfully long flowers dangle for
several feet and close it off.
Fewer people know about the Judas Tree, which will also cover an arch. It
flowers sparsely, but its leaves are pretty and can be eaten in salads early
in summer.
Otherwise, if you want to be showy and original, where should you look?
On my dry, stony soil, it is no use relying only on roses: they grow
wretchedly and develop black spot by midsummer. On happier soils, I still
think that the pale pink-white New Dawn is in a class by itself on an
archway. In general, I prefer repeat-flowering climbers with big flowers to
the rampant, once-flowering ramblers which are recommended most often.
I prefer anything to the newish, pink Sophies Perpetual. I find its colour
beastly and I am struggling to stop its harsh flowers from appearing
throughout the year. Mrs Herbert Stevens is a lovely double white and, in
sunny, sheltered places, my beloved apricot, Lady Hillingdon, is excellent
because her flowers tend to droop and thus appear through the ceiling of the
arch.
What, though, if roses dislike you, or you wish to vary the scene?
I am sure of one thing which Monet never knew. The outstanding clematis on
an arch is Perle d'Azur, which is at its best now and is so wonderfully
vigorous that it will thrive and flower unstoppably.
Otherwise, where do we look? In mild gardens or expatriate bunkers, I would
go straight for the lovely white Solanum jasminoides, but it will not
survive hard winters in open ground on a British arch.
White jasmines in Britain are usually rather scruffy, with more leaf than
flower. I could live with an entire arch of honeysuckle, but most of them
will not live with anything else because they throttle it and reduce you to
their single season.
The better-behaved varieties, Dropmore Scarlet and the scented Graham
Thomas, are not at their best in full sunlight. The main point of an arch is
to cast shade in an over-exposed position: the climbers have to be able to
take full sun on their heads, and some of the honeysuckles will turn brown.
Passion flowers, golden hops and Chinese gooseberries are all a mess. After
studying lists of climbers, I am inclined to abandon them and consider
training and pruning particular trees. At Kiftsgate Court, in
Gloucestershire, the rose garden is rounded off by a fine arch of
whitebeams, trained together and clipped hard. At Greys Court near Henley,
Oxfordshire, you can see an airy arch of pink-flowered acacias. Hazels are
worthy, but very dull.
My present thought is that the neglected staphylea might be the answer for
those who want a change. It carries hanging bunches of white flowers, in its
better forms, and it comes at that awkward moment in late May. I will report
on progress.
Monet, I suspect, would say that the answer was obvious and the correct
decision is to plant more wisterias. They grew to look superb on his wide
Japanese bridge. Somehow, though, I do not wish to be obvious and will
probably live to regret it: hold fast for news of a staphylea, unless you
come up with a better idea.

FT  12 FEB 94 / Gardening: The maniacs have taken over at the nursery - A
garden centre that thrives on tidiness and teamwork
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I was under glass in a Midlands field, not far from Wolverhampton, as the
rain drove in from the south-west. But who cares about the weather when
hardy winter plants are flowering by the 100?
Eight years ago, when Weekend FT was started, I went to the Midlands to look
for an emerging market which might survive Margaret Thatcher, prime minister
of the day. I thought I had found it at Ashwood Nurseries, at Kingswinford,
north of Kidderminster, off the A449.
They were making a name for their new Lewisias, small hardy plants which
carry showers of flower in late spring and vary from the easy to the
awkward. The place had quality and the management struck me as something
special so I wrote and said so.
Mrs Thatcher has now become Lady Thatcher but I still have my Ashwood
Lewisias and many readers have turned up at that Midlands nursery with a
crumpled page from an old FT.
My discovery of garden centres was characteristically welcomed by Arthur
Hellyer, the FT's gardening writer for more than 30 years, during the
Chelsea flower show nearly two years ago. How I wish Arthur, who died in
January last year, could have rediscovered this one with me.
Three weeks ago, I was making an anti-clockwise tour of London's first
flower show of the season. I was enjoying the specialists' Hellebores and
admiring the winter greenery when I hit on the best exhibit of them all.
Carpets of pink, white and magenta hardy cyclamen ran beneath winter prunus,
witch hazel and a display of Lenten Roses and hybrid forms of Helleborus
Orientalis.
It seemed to have a height, colour and clearness of leaf which was new.
Mid-winter seemed a mirage; even the Royal Horticultural Society judges gave
the stand a gold medal.
It turned out to be Ashwood Nurseries taking their fifth gold medal in their
fifth RHS show. Following them back to base, I found that the news for
gardeners was excellent. Since 1986, the nursery has grown 20-fold; it
employs 53 people and its new initiatives are the gold-winning cyclamen and
hellebores, built up in the last three years.
The founder, John Massey, is the son of an engineer and recalls that his
best subject at school was Latin. 'I am absolutely hopeless with money,' he
assures me. 'I leave the bills entirely to the others; I haven't a clue
about business rules, except that businesses which follow the rules seem to
go broke.'
He does not bother with a computer, and when he thought he had 300 stock
plants of hardy cyclamen, Philip Baulk, his breeder-collaborator, had to
point out that they already had more than 800. (I should add that Baulk has
found no satisfactory system for automatic watering and every single plant
is watered by hand.)
This archaic enterprise has two irreplaceable assets that has enabled it to
progress. It insists absolutely on top quality and immaculate tidiness, and
devotional team work, seven days a week, from managers who are still in it
for the sake of the plants and the customers, not the share option or the
meaningless meeting.
For years, hardy cyclamen have had their own expert society and hellebores
have had some great breeders: Ashwood's team has now moved into these
revered pastures, backed by their skill in Lewisias and the application of
cash made from their nursery's general quality stock.
Are the heroes of the hellebore rather uneasy, I asked, thinking of the
Whites and their recent medals at Blackthorn in Hampshire; the legendary
Helen Ballard, queen for years of the rounded flower without spots; and
Elizabeth Strangman, author with Graham Rice of the best of the new
hellebore books, just published by David &amp; Charles at Pounds 16.99.
Ashwood's answer is that they have had no hard feelings. The reigning
experts have passed on many of their best plants and are enjoying the
results as new crosses extend the base which they have established.
On visiting Ashwood, I think they have sensed what everyone does: the place
is run by plant maniacs to whom you could not wish ill if you tried.
Go and see it: the cyclamen coum and the Lenten hellebores ought to be good
for this weekend and next. In late April, the Lewisias are flat out. They
are 14-years-old in some cases and the stock has been increased by the
owners' fact-finding visit to the plants' native Pacific homes in America.
This year, 3,000 Hellebores, newly created from three-year-old crosses, have
been sold at Pounds 5.95 each. Next year, the target is 10,000.
The cyclamen, meanwhile, are sold through a seed list which is issued in
June to those who write in with a stamp. The nursery grows seed for Suttons
and sells the rest of it fresh for sowing in September.
Its coum strain, supervised by Philip Baulk, is spectacular and completely
hardy. If you sow it in September, you should have a thick range of
seedlings up and showing by Christmas.
The Hellebores are truly exciting. Lesser operations could only sell a few
dozen from amateurs' stocks each year, but Ashwood has the staff and scale
to go for a huge market. In their private houses, I saw whites,
grey-purples, green and cream yellows and exquisite pinks quite apart from
the sombre purples and blacks.
I hate the doubles and John Massey is not too keen on them either. Spotted
forms are charming, although purists have sometimes frowned on them: Ashwood
whites with purple blotches promise to have a vigour and charm which was
beginning to dwindle from some of the older experts' bloodlines.
Outdoors, we can all grow these deep-rooting beauties which like to be left
in peace.
The old leaves should be cut off in spring when the new ones appear; they
will tolerate shade, even in London, but they do not require it. They love
to be fed repeatedly in spring and summer. In February they are heavenly,
building into clumps which improve yearly, although mice have chewed my
latest white's flowers.
You can divide them, but divisions will take two or three years to settle
in.
You can also grow them in pots, where they look very tempting: Ashwood
confirmed that you should only water them from the bottom by standing them
in a saucer and watering it, not by watering the soil directly from above.
I hope the place and its Hellebores break all the rules, except immaculate
neatness, and continue to prove my one attempt at sector-analysis to be
right.
I also recall another Arthur Hellyer rule: great gardening enterprises tend
to rely on pairs, each half of which needs the other.
At Ashwood, Massey needs Baulk, the master breeder, and both will need
Kevin, active with the Hellebores and Philip, who they snatched from a
career servicing aircraft.
They do not reckon much to horticultural college training: how can you teach
a passion for plants? Could they also teach me tidiness? After brief
consideration, they regretted that tidiness, too, was brought to the job,
not learned on it.

HOW THEY KILLED THE LITTLE GIRL IN HER;
</P>
<P>
LION AT THE DOOR BY DAVID ATTOE (LITTLE, BROWN: $17.95; 232 PP.)
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Margot Mifflin, Mifflin is a contributing editor at Elle magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
Though "mature" writers from John Updike to Saul Bellow recently have been
chided for their two-dimensional depictions of women in fiction, David Attoe's
explosive first novel, "Lion at the Door," proves that you don't have to be a
woman to penetrate the female psyche. Attoe wiggles into the mind of Hazel
Sapper, a girl growing up in industrial England in the 1950s, to reveal the
ruin of her youth -- and life -- by her sexually abusive father. Through the
voices of Hazel, her daughter and her childhood friend Rosko, Attoe convinces
us that time doesn't heal all wounds.
</P>
<P>
Hazel describes her bleak family life in the poetically coarse, abbreviated
dialect of the English Midlands, where her father is a coal miner. Her tender
but defeated mother is impotent in the face of her husband's violence. The
girl's only sanctuary is in books, which her father considers evil, and in
Rosko, who takes her to the hut in the woods he built as an escape from his own
domestic hell. Attoe communicates all the girlish charm of Hazel's fervid mind
while he teases out the brutal realities -- rape, "hidings," the girl's
thwarted literary ambitions -- that will eventually jaundice it. She indulges
in loving descriptions of the countryside and has a special fondness for birds
and plant life, her only reference to a free and unpolluted world:
</P>
<P>
"And then the gray wagtail, that had scurried up the shallows along the stream,
said tzissi tzissi, and dipped its head and neck forward with every movement,
as if it was agreeing with itself, as it flickered over the watery stones."
</P>
<P>
After Hazel and Rosko are beaten by their parents for falling asleep in the
hideaway overnight, the boy runs away, and Hazel's remaining school years are
tinged with loneliness. She waits longingly for his return, then gives up: "I
realized there was nothing left to wait for and I knew I'd have to be like them
now with today and tomorrow separate, bossing me . . . I didn't want to hate,
but I did."
</P>
<P>
The narrative then passes to Hazel's estranged daughter, who's come home for
her mother's funeral 25 years later. Daughter (also named Hazel) feels nothing
for the impassive woman who, she learns from a family friend, bore two children
by a violent, alcoholic husband after a shotgun wedding, then was abandoned. In
short, Hazel's capacity for love was suffocated by the brutal men in her life
and the economic trap they forced her into. Her children -- the products of her
degradation and defeat -- never knew the playfully intrepid person who once
inhabited her chilly shell.
</P>
<P>
When Rosko assumes the narrative voice in the book's final chapter, he's a
reminder of what could have been, just as daughter Hazel is evidence of what
was. We don't know half enough about his life or the daughter's, but we learn
that he returned to Hazel a year before her death to reclaim her friendship,
only to find her broken and vengeful: "I didn't want what was his inside me,"
she reflects on her first pregnancy. "Once it was in you, leeching for a life
you didn't have to give, what did it matter what color eyes or hair it would
have . . . He wanted no different from what my soddin' father did . . . Took it
the same way. Rough."
</P>
<P>
This is a relentlessly dark novel, and the question arises: Could a woman bear
children without ever loving them? Considering the increasing number of mothers
who drop their infants out of windows or stuff them in garbage cans, however,
Hazel's plight is not unrealistic. Attoe avoids letting his tale sink into a
maelstrom of misery by animating his three narrators with rage and imbuing them
with a vivid, Faulkneresque sense of the local landscape and dialect. He grants
the reader the final satisfaction of the reunion, at which Rosko is able to
coax forth a glimmer of the girl he once knew. He later vows to take her some
garden plants to persuade her to see him again, but what happens between them
in the months before her death is left to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
While many first novels are dashed off with cheap cynicism and smug urbanity,
"Lion at the Door" is a gold mine of complexity, both psychological and
structural. Attoe has a muscular prose style in which nouns often double as
verbs, and he's able to shift narrative voices -- male and female -- with
idiosyncratic realism. Perfectly tuned, exquisitely told, "Lion at the Door" is
thorny beauty.

FT  11 APR 92 / Gardening: Scots soil to suit the bonnie heather - A garden
to visit: Arthur Hellyer starts a new series with a trip to a whisky
distillery's acreage in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most remarkable gardens in Scotland today belongs to a whisky
distillery. Bell's Cherrybank Gardens is a seven-acre extension to an
existing 11-acre garden which had already created a considerable name for
itself.
It all started when new office premises for Arthur Bell and Sons were opened
on the western outskirts of Perth, overlooking the city and the Tay valley.
This was a straightforward piece of industrial landscaping, started in 1978,
involving the use of trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants and water on a
considerable scale.
Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall-Sportswork was awarded the contract; the
firm is said to have planted 65,000 shrubs and 1,200 trees, plus an
unspecified number of hardy perennials. Informal in design, a river-like
lake at its lowest point is fed partly by a natural burn. It has a complex
pattern of curving lawns and flower beds with dense, labour-saving planting
and great attractiveness for wildlife.
A notable feature of this garden is an elaborate mosaic, made with Italian
glass, which depicts a coat-of-arms. This fine garden, which is open to the
public, was given a Civic Trust Award in 1982.
But this is not my reason for drawing attention to the Bell's garden today.
What is important nationwide is Bell's Cherrybank Gardens, started in 1984
on seven acres of land adjacent to the office garden but rising well above
it, and intended as a heather garden.
It has its own water features, and the overall design was also by Robert
Matthew Johnson-Marshall-Sportswork, but the heather collection was planned
by Hazel Huddlestone. It is extremely impressive and already occupies a
large part of the ground, although there is still scope for extension.
There are now about 40,000 heather plants in 730 varieties. Norrie
Robertson, the head gardener, told me that he does all heather planting in
March. He waters all plants thoroughly before planting - and not very much
afterwards - and he uses a lot of pit sand when planting.
The soil is naturally a little acid, and this suits all heathers well, but
there was near disaster in the early days when the M90 motorway was being
constructed above the garden. A large quantity of lime was present in the
foundation material used for the road, and some of this washed down into the
garden, raising the alkalinity. However, the excess lime was washed out and
there have been no further problems from that source.
The heathers are in superb condition, planted in large blocks,in big curving
beds spread on the open hillside which provides a spectacular site for
display. Its excellence has been recognised by its designation as one of the
two National Collections of Heathers in Britain by the National Council for
the Conservation of Plants and Gardens, the other being in the Royal
Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey, a very different site on
flat ground with numerous small trees including conifers.
Cherrybank has its own landscaping, quite distinct from that of the office
garden. There are fewer trees and shrubs, as befits its hillside situation
and prime use for heather cultivation, and it contains several other
features, including a children's playground, a dovecot stocked with
fantails, an aviary and a trellis garden with a set of tubular bells.
There is also a stream starting high up in the garden, artificially fed. The
water flows sinuously down the hillside between clean, stone-lined banks,
feeding several ponds. One of these is said to have remarkable acoustic
properties, creating different sounds as the water plays against the
circular surrounds. There are also a number of attractive statues, some the
work of Ian MacKintosh, others by Lawrence Broderick.
A visitor centre has been built at the top of the Cherrybank Gardens, which
also contains a small restaurant. It is now the main point of entry to both
the heather and the office gardens: the two, although separate entities, are
inter-connected.
Norrie Robertson heads a team of five gardeners who keep the place in
impeccable condition. About 20,000 visitors are welcomed every year, and
money is collected for charity from collecting-boxes, and from a
wishing-well.
The gardens are open on the first weekend in May until the middle of
October. The heather garden is never without flowers throughout the year:
one of the great attractions of heathers is that the numerous species
provide a continuous succession of flowers - though some seasons,
particularly spring and late summer to autumn, are more prolific than
others.

<HEAD>Atlanta Club Trying for 1998 Winter Olympics Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Now that Atlanta has the 1996 Summer Games in the
bag, a local men's club has launched a tongue-in-cheek campaign to
promote the city as host for the 1998 Winter Olympics.
   The Atlanta Millionaires Club has suggested activities including
slalom tractor pulls, snowmobile demolition derbies and contests to
determine who is most guilt-free about taking off from work because
of a few snow flurries.
   The temperature ``didn't stop us from getting the summer
Olympics,'' lawyer Tully Hazell, chairman of the winter events
committee, said Monday. ``We can't think small here.''
   Billy Payne, who put together Atlanta's winning proposal to be
host for the 1996 Summer Games, will serve as honorary chairman for
the group's unofficial kickoff for the 1998 bid Dec. 1.
   Donations collected during the kickoff will go to The Howard
Schools, which help those with learning disabilities in Atlanta.
   Hazell said the club would not let Atlanta's winter temperatures
with average highs in the 60s be a deterrent to the Olympic quest.
   ``Once we put our climate issue behind us, I think Atlanta has a
lot of things to offer as the site of the Winter Games,'' Hazell
said. ``First of all, it's generally pretty warm here in February,
so you probably won't have to get all bundled up when you go out to
watch the events.''
   Backup plans call for tobacco spitting and cow tipping contests.
   Payne said the Atlanta Millionaires Club has about 50 members.
   ``We have a very select but diverse membership,'' he said. ``The
way I would describe it is if you were at your wife's or
girlfriend's Christmas parties, we would be the guys that would be
standing around the bar.''

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAY my wife wrecked her car was a good one for dormice. In no time the
recently vacated car-port was taken over by three large cages and I was
licensed as a keeper in the dormouse captive breeding and release scheme.
Dormice are mouse-sized rodents, ginger in colour with furry tails, which
hibernate for more than half the year and emerge during darkness to feed
high in the trees.
It is hardly surprising that their numbers had become severely depleted
before anyone noticed.
It was not always thus. The hazel dormouse tends to live in areas of hazel
coppice where the spreading limbs of the older trees provide it with aerial
routes essential for its arboreal lifestyle. Rich hazelnuts enable it to
almost double its weight before hibernation.
In the past, coppicing was a major industry in the countryside and hazel was
an important component of the rural scene, providing material for hurdles,
thatching pegs, tool handles and fuel for charcoal.
Woodsmen often came across dormice and they were kept as pets by children.
In 1882, Theodore Compton, in his book on the Mendip Hills, wrote: 'The
pretty dormouse, more squirrel than mouse, is sometimes caught by our
village boys who call it the seven sleeper.' The dormouse often sleeps for
seven months of the year.
This long hibernation is matched in the summer by periods of torpor, when
the weather is poor or food is scarce, from which the dormouse can take up
to 15 minutes to awaken.
The disappearance of hazel coppice and hedgerows has not only deprived
dormice of their habitat but also their means to move from one wood to
another, for they rarely come down to the ground unless to hibernate. Many
coppice woodlands have been reclaimed for agriculture while others have been
felled and replanted with conifers.
Even those purchased by conservation organisations generally have been
managed to encourage woodland flora. Such regimes are rarely sympathetic to
the needs of the dormouse.
It is to emphasise the plight of this elusive and secretive mammal that
English Nature, as part of its Species Recovery Programme, has declared
eight days next month, October 27 to November 3, National Dormouse Week.
Information will be available on the threat to dormice and their habitat,
guidance on the special needs of dormice will be given to woodland owners
and managers, and everyone will be invited to take part in the Great Nut
Hunt.
Dormice extract the nut kernels from hazel shells in a characteristic way
and, by searching for such shells and sending them to a centre, members of
the public can help English Nature to improve its knowledge of the status
and distribution of these mammals.
Dormice are thought to have disappeared completely from a number of northern
and eastern counties of Britain. Only recently, for instance, were they
discovered in a Northumberland wood and none is believed to exist in
Scotland.
The Great Nut Hunt will continue into 1994 and it is hoped that as many
people as possible, especially children, will take part.
An increasing number of woodlands are being found which, possibly because of
benign neglect over the years, have all the right ingredients to supply the
needs of dormice yet lack the animals themselves.
The captive breeding scheme aims to put dormice back into these woods by
controlled releases of dormice bred in captivity. The parents of the
released animals are taken from the wild in the autumn if, on November 1,
they weigh less than 14g (half an ounce).
Late litters do not have time to amass enough fat to keep them ticking over
during hibernation. Under normal circumstances they would die.
Instead, they are taken into captivity and fed throughout the winter.
Their young are released into the wild using special release cages. These
contain food so the dormice can return at night to supplement their diet
until they have learned enough to fend for themselves. Several animals were
released last spring using this method, into a secret woodland location in
the eastern counties.
These dormice bred during the summer and four litters have been recorded.
Now they have to find suitable places to hibernate and survive the winter -
the most dangerous part of any hibernator's life. But then sleeping seems to
be what dormice do best.
To take part in the Great Nut Hunt, write to: English Nature, (NDW),
Northminster House, Peterborough, PE1 1UA or Countryside Council for Wales
(NDW), 43-45 The Parade, Roath, Cardiff, CF2 3UH for a survey pack which
includes full instructions.
The Mammal Society has published a useful booklet called Dormice, by Paul
Bright and Pat Morris. Pounds 2.50 inc p&amp;p from the Mammal Society Office,
Zoology Department, University of Bristol, Woodland Road, Bristol BS8 1UG.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Outdoors: These long dry spells can make you go grey -
Gardening / Robin Lane Fox enthuses over the advantages of grey and
silver-leafed plants, particularly for hot summers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rain in southern England has stopped gardens from going grey. It has
also stopped me from going grey with them.
Long dry spells are horrible and for 10 weeks, we have had to look at burnt
sweet peas, brown phloxes and dead lower stems on those pillars of late
summer, the white-flowered Lysimachia Ephemerum and white veronicastrum.
Wherever I garden, the Good Lord makes it difficult. Six years ago, I
started to massacre Leyland Cypresses and to make a new garden over their
former home. Since then, we have had seriously dry weather in four of the
summers, sending me back to the old principle of suiting a new planting to
the soil and climate.
Even if it rains until October, I intend to think more in grey than in green
for the rest of the ground plan. Grey leaves like dry weather; they are
better in hot summers; they hold August together and this weekend, you can
save yourself a small fortune by multiplying them from cuttings, best rooted
now without any overhead watering or complicated equipment.
Grey and silver plants survive between two extremes: frost and damp. Some of
the most beautiful will not survive a serious winter; most of them hate a
wet soil or clay. The best guide to the extremes remains the late Mrs
Underwood's book, Grey and Silver Plants, first published by Collins in the
early 1970s.
I hesitate to call her an Essex girl, but she did grow, sell and select the
best of the greys and silvers in her nursery near Colchester and global
warming has yet to do anything to put her out of date. She grades the
possible plants on a scale of hardiness, but to the west of Oxford, I have
learnt to be less optimistic and add a further point to her grades, taking
no chances.
On the hardy side, new winners emerge as we all garden more sceptically. She
never fully discussed the silver oleasters, but they are the poor Briton's
substitute for those wonderful orchards of silver-grey olives which you are
envying or imagining this month in your Mediterranean dreams.
The Latin name for the family is Elaeagnus and it includes a superb
silver-leaved tree which is less familiar than the popular Silver Pear but
even prettier when the sun preys on its glistening leaves. The basic form is
Elaeagnus angustifolia, but nurseries have now selected one called
Quicksilver which is self-explanatory.
Its natural home is up in the extraordinary heat of the Caspian Sea area and
it will tolerate the awful stony and sandy soil of gardens near the seaside
or wherever I seem to settle. It is not a tree for screen and it is rather
bright. It is a feature which I would prefer towards a green boundary, but
it is an extremely good one.
In a smaller space, the best bet is the shrubby Elaeagnus commutata which
turns up as a centrepiece in artistic exhibits at Chelsea flower show. It
runs around by suckers and can be increased very easily by digging up a
rooted piece, it looks splendid on a dry bank, but its natural height is
slightly too tall for the middle of a normal border.
You can prune it, but you should do so after midsummer so that you do not
remove its particular delight - its scented little yellow flowers along the
joints of the stems in early June.
What other silver shrub flowers with a scent to equal a sharp lilac? This
small Oleaster has been one of the successes of this testing season and I
hope that many more gardeners will now try it, although it is not evergreen.
Among the smaller silver shrubs, I opt for the controversial curry plant.
Whenever you brush against it, it smells like an Indian dinner. Delhi
descends on the paved front garden and I am mentally transported to one of
those hot evenings, when the cows seem to have collapsed on the hillside and
their bones show through as if all air has been let out of their hides.
More prosaically, Helichrysum angustifolium is totally hardy, spreads to a
width of about two feet, covers itself in buds of an exquisite ivory-grey
and develops flowers of a strong mustard yellow which are somehow rather
sociable. I like the upright spiral of the young growth, the effect of
silver spires and and the dependability.
Curry-haters dislike it, but I put it first because it persists until the
outer edges of the bush go brown and it is time for very hard pruning after
flowering. It will multiply with ridiculous ease from cuttings.
Apply the two golden rules for propagation of almost every silver plant.
Pull off a stem which has hardened, rather than a soft little shoot from the
top of the bush. Take the cuttings now and leave them outdoors without
excessive watering.
They will root unless they become too damp, whereupon they rot. I find that
they are weekenders' easiest strike, because their owners are away from a
watering can for most of the week, allowing them to get on with it.
From the scent of India, I move westwards back to Greece. This month, one of
the few happy plants in the dust of the summer is the felted grey-green
Ballota with rounded leaves. It turns up in walls, on donkey tracks or on
bare landscapes by Aegean beaches. In Britain, it is surprisingly hardy in a
dry soil and I have kept plants of it since 1982.
Knowing gardeners nowadays chase after an apple-green form called All
Hallows Green, but I have left the stampede and am happy with the plain grey
pseudo dictamnus. It makes a bushy plant, especially if you clip it lightly
in early summer and it spreads charmingly in the front of any border,
improving as this summer has killed many of its companions.
The flowers and stems are a lovely accompaniment for small bunches of cut
pinks or summer flowers and they age gradually, becoming woody, rather than
dead. You can split them or root young growths with ease.
Nearer to the frost line, I must end with my star turn to date in this
difficult year. The silver-leaved Teucrium fruticans is not a certain
survivor in the open, but we have grown it in Oxford since 1983, where the
same old plants are flourishing in a dry bed against a south wall.
As a result, I recommend it wholeheartedly. It may look drab after a severe
winter, but you can cut it back in late April and it will regain its
elegance by midsummer and flower charmingly in a shade of pale blue which
persists on and off until autumn.
Be warned that the dark blue form is even more seductive, but markedly less
hardy. I like this shrub, up to 4ft high anywhere, but it has a particular
use which is invaluable. Usually, the windows of houses in the UK do not go
fully to the ground, and so we are left with a stretch of wall which is too
low for a serious climber.
Here, facing south or west, the Teucrium is in its element, although it has
the characteristic spread and slight untidiness which I value in parts of
the garden. If you are neat, smart and a perfectly-pressed sort of person,
you may find that it is too spreading if it survives for three or four
years.
If so, we disagree, because I believe that this wonderfully silver plant is
greatly under-used in southern England and in cities and that it is one of
the saving graces left to us after so long without serious rain.

FT  27 NOV 93 / Gardening: Digging in to stop the rot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharp weather concentrates the mind, and the past week raises questions of
frost and damp. Despite appearances, though, the frosts have not been so
lethal as weatherpersons inclined us to think.
I measure them by the scale of 1991 when frost at the same season damaged
many of my half-hardy plants, including penstemons, beyond recovery. This
year, their top growth is unscathed, partly because the previous weeks had
been colder and their growth had slowed already. I had also taken a
precaution, which I recommend.
Just before the freeze, I double-wrapped my marginals in that great newcomer
to garden centres, Fibre Fleece. This is a thin, white drape, like a nylon
scarf, which takes many degrees off the frost or wind while allowing water
to pass through and reach the roots of plants underneath. Now, we can wrap
up vulnerable plants without exposing them to drought or rot. Thanks to
Fibre Fleece, I still have unscorched silver convolvulus, living diascias
and last year's verbena.
Fibre Fleece comes in amply-priced packs for people with a few plants which
they treat like pets. Those with bigger gardens should look for the large
rolls at the back of the store: otherwise, they are available from such
trade suppliers of garden goods as Joseph Bentley on Humberside. Owners of
bigger gardens need to shop around.
I wish there was a similar fleecing that would cope with the problem of
damp. Between now and March, this is as much of a killer as frost, but we
hear less about it because its effects are more haphazard.
The thaw after a hard frost begins the problem. The frost upsets the fleshy
leaves on plants like the blue-flowered agapanthus; but the lethal
consequence is the damp, which then sits on the main crown and causes the
plant to rot.
The other day, I read an expert who was saying that my latest pleasures, the
late-flowering schizostylis, are not fully hardy in winter. What he means
(an expert grower assured me) is that, sometimes, they will rot away in a
wet winter or after a thaw. This weakness is widespread, not least among
plants with silver leaves.
As the frost leaves us, how are we to cope with damp? On a small scale, we
can dig grit or gravel round the roots and necks of alpines, pinks and
silver plants when first we put them into the ground. Even now, we can
usefully surround them with a layer of gravel to sharpen drainage until
spring.
On a larger scale, I find the problem more perplexing. How, for instance, do
you deal with endemic damp all over a flower bed? The only answer is to
drain it; but I have always skipped the ritual chapter on herring-bone
drains in the old gardening dictionaries. The FT forgot to check this point
before engaging me, but in those days they had the late Arthur Hellyer
instead. He had land-drained and herring-drained more square rods of soil
than any of us.
What, then, does Hellyer recommend for beds which are turning into a swamp?
His Gardening Encyclopedia (the 1993 edition is published by Hamlyn at the
remarkably low price of Pounds 14.99 for 784 pages) is clear and
uncompromising. On wet land, dig narrow trenches about 12 ft apart down to
the level where the sub-soil becomes a pan on which the water sits. I have
had a trench-digger; as a result, my future carrot bed looks like roadworks,
with a pattern of trenches in which water is now sitting or trickling.
Perfectionists would now lay drainpipes at this level, but I am not entirely
sure we have reached the level where they are most effective. The easier
option is to fill each trench with better drainage: Hellyer recommends
well-burned clinkers from a boiler because they are especially hard and
angular. No doubt clinkers would solve the problem - but, out in the modern
Cotswolds, they have given way to gas.
Certainly, a system of trenches is the answer to a poorly-drained area, but
the cheapest possibility is to trust Hellyer and choose a faggot drain
instead. This under-publicised option has much going for it. You find your
faggots, lay them end to end in the trenches, cover them with turf (placed
with the grass downwards), and then replace the topsoil to cover the burial.
'Well-made faggot drains will remain effective for years,' says Hellyer; in
our gadget-minded generation, though, most of us probably have forgotten
about them.
The question arises: where do you find a suitable faggot? Country residents
will have no problems: they need only to cut bundles of brushwood from a
hedgerow, choosing hazel wherever possible.
These bundles can be dropped into the trench, but you need to be sure the
wood is not too soft or short of side branches. Then, you surface with turf
and replace enough soil for a decent cabbage on top.
If you cannot fleece it, faggot it: damp, at least, can be drained away,
whereas frost retains the unpredictability which caught us all short this
week and makes winter survival such a hazard.

FT  01 MAY 93 / Gardening: 'Plan in May and go away' is good advice -
Viburnums are the lime-loving alternative to rhododendrons, says Robin Lane
Fox, who has his favourites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY IN May, you do not want to be living on my sort of soil. It cannot
grow azaleas, camellias hate it, and a rhododendron will not survive for
more than a month. Elsewhere in Britain, plantations, woods and glens are
near their best for this convenient holiday weekend.
Sometimes, the best is too lurid; I have never reconciled myself to the
bright rhododendrons which have intruded on the great 18th century garden at
Stourhead. Elsewhere, the mauves and sugar pinks have been kept under
control and the light, damp and shading make an Oriental flora look at home
in Scotland. On lime, the rest of us have two options: to go visiting or to
find an alternative which will put up with the conditions.
This weekend, visiting is extremely tempting. The great gardens on acid soil
are slightly ahead of themselves and near their best already: they include
the Isabella plantation in London's Richmond Park, the Savill gardens in
Windsor, Exbury or Leonardslee in the south, or Bodnant in north Wales. If
you cannot grow it, view it: you do not have to live with all the dreary
foliage out of season. In gardens, too, 'plan in May and go away.'
Back home, gardeners on a lime soil need a mid-May alternative. In recent
years, I have been looking for shrubs which can be clipped and trained into
small pseudo-trees, or bushes on standard stems.
It strikes me that the state of the art is to invent a touch of style which
puts familiar plants in an original light. Shrubs on stems like standards
give class, quality and scope for adventure. They need not be expensive, and
I rather suspect that we have still scarcely scratched the surface of the
possibilities. Mercifully, the best of them flower in the mid-May gap and
will tolerate lime, compensating for absent azaleas.
In the retarded Cotswolds, we have yet to see the best of this year's lilacs
but, when they come, mine will be small trees, maintained at eye level by
light pruning. Lilacs work wonderfully as specimen standards, spaced down a
long border or used as upright sentinels instead of yet another columnar
cherry.
Admittedly, they are greedy shrubs which compete for good soil in a border;
but when lucky gardeners are enjoying their white haze of rhododendron
Loderi, these trained lilacs are no small compensation. My favourite is the
purple and white-striped lilac Sensation, which grows into a tree about 6 ft
high, but any of the heavy double purples and single sky-blues are almost as
good if you avoid varieties of maximum spread and vigour.
Take an ordinary bush of lilac; thin it down to one single stem; prevent it
from making top growth until the stem is about 4 ft high - and then allow it
to develop a cluster of shoots in a head which will be a substitute for any
good camellia on alkaline soil.
Honeysuckles respond admirably to the same styling if you tie one main stem
on to a 4 ft cane and allow only the top growth to develop through a
circular metal plant support fixed at the cane's summit. Early and late
Dutch honeysuckles are excellent candidates for this job, but my favourite
for mid-May is the heavily-scented Graham Thomas form, the pale, creamy
blooms of which are just bursting into their stickily-sweet flower. Limit it
to one stem; then, let it spread into a head which you trim without mercy
next month after flowering.
At a Gloucestershire nursery, I have been watching bushes of the
white-flowered Choisya, trained similarly into the shape of little evergreen
trees. They seem to work remarkably well and will hold their scented white
blooms at the level of your face, leaving you to decide if you really like
the smell. Here, too, if you can be patient for two or three years, you need
buy only an ordinary shrub. Train it on a single stem up a cane and prevent
any side shoots until it has developed the shape of a standard rose tree.
In warm towns, wisterias are bursting with flower already and will work
marvellously in the same tree format. But, lovely though they are, I think
the best of all candidates are this month's viburnums.
In May, viburnums are the lime-lovers' definitive answer to woods of
enviable rhododendrons. As bushes, the most refined forms are the named
varieties of viburnum Carlesii: Dawn Aurora, which have exceptional elegance
of bud, leaf and pinkish white flowers, the star performers in the family.
As standards or small trees, they are slow-growing and perhaps too refined.
At the other extreme, evergreen forms like the obliging Burkwoodii and Park
Farm Hybrid are too vigorous for tree training. The forms with horizontal
branches are completely unsuitable, lovely though they are in May. Juddii is
a much better bet, more robust than Carlesii and responsive to light
clipping. Personally, I have majored on viburnum Carlcephalum and, in its
fourth year, I am delighted with it.
Among the hybrids, it has exceptional vigour. It has the biggest heads of
flower plus the usual gust of scent, and its leaf is sufficiently grey not
to look too coarse. Nonetheless, a refined taste suspects it of being
vulgar. It is a typical breeders' variety, bigger and bolder than the
delicate parents.
Still, I am sufficiently vulgar to like it as my garden's main backbone,
growing into the shape of standards. Do not judge it when the heads of
flower are still in bud and have a drab buff tone to them. When they open,
the effect is all white, luminous across a lawn when dusk descends on a bank
holiday.
I have clipped eight bushes of this variety into tall, upright shapes by
trimming them after flowering. Like almost all forms of viburnum, it will
reach you with one little trap. Nursery growers have grafted it on to much
coarser stock. You need to watch carefully for stems with the wrong leaves
and a russet-brown colouring, and to cut them off immediately below ground
level. Otherwise, Carlcephalum gets on with the job. As a surrogate tree, I
recommend it from happy experience.
By a pleasant coincidence, every one of these shrubs for tree training
reaches its best in mid to late May and tolerates lime in the soil. With
ingenuity gardeners can, therefore, make up for the impossibility of
azaleas.
In nurseries, shrubs in standard shapes tend to sell for Pounds 20 or more,
as if they are virtuoso features. Actually, they are dead easy. And although
you will still want to visit our public glades of May-flowering shrubs from
the east, you will find on returning home that these contrived little trees
show old friends in a new light in any garden, however small.

The last time Hawke broke down on television was when he referred in 1984 to
drug problems among members of his family. Hazel Hawke later went on television
to explain that their daughter, Roslyn, and her husband, Matt, had been treated
for heroin addiction.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hawke said today's admission is not new. "All this has been
said before," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Hawke has said he will seek a record fourth term as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Hawke was asked what people mean when they accuse him of
being a womanizer.
</P>
<P>
"They mean I was unfaithful to my wife," Hawke replied.
</P>
<P>
Robertson: "Is that true?"
</P>
<P>
Hawke: "Yes."
</P>
<P>
Robertson: "Did you stop that?"
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Hawke replied in tears, and then, "I guess there are not many women who
would have put up with me all that time. But my love for her never changes. I
have always loved Hazel, always will."
</P>
<P>
Hawke also referred to his past drinking, which his biographer Blanche
d'Alpuget says earned him an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records when
he drank 2 1/2 pints of beer in 12 seconds while studying at Oxford University
in Britain. Hawke quit drinking in 1979.

FT  05 SEP 92 / Gardening: I'm dreaming of a white autumn - How he plans to
keep the white flag flowering until the first frosts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETCHED on every ambitious gardener's mind is the image of white flowers, set
against dark green hedges and shown off in the cool of a summer evening. No
doubt it has been deeply etched on those of you trapped in a freak European
summer, where the swimming-pools turned green, the children nearly
suffocated, and the railway lines melted in the extreme Italian heat. Back
in England, the railway lines have other problems; swimming-pools will be
swimming-pools, but the gales and sudden coldness have not wiped out the
image of pale flowers as the garden turns peacefully towards autumn. White
gardens now stretch far beyond their famous model at Sissinghurst Castle. It
takes skill to keep the white flag flying in September and, personally, I
relish the challenge.
By early autumn, white flowers are widely believed to have gone into
retreat. White corners are a tangle of old campanulas; white roses are out
of season; and the white flowers on the giant crambe have vanished, leaving
a mass of leaves like yellow cabbage. The best white flowers are not a soft
colour which needs to be segregated. They can easily compete with yellows,
deep blues, and especially strong reds. I would rather use them at intervals
round a small garden, especially in the darker setting of a back garden in
the city: they are more impressive if they are not isolated.
This year, any expatriate would pine for some of our Japanese anemones,
which are flowering madly after a summer with so much late rain. They ought
to be a town gardener's first choice for a welcome home after the summer
holiday. They will put up with dry shade and life in a narrow bed below a
London wall. They need a few years to give of their best and should never be
judged by their first two seasons' performance. I have compared the
varieties carefully and I am convinced that it is worth paying more for the
white form with the biggest single flowers. Geante des Blanches is its true
name, although this lady giant sometimes turns up as White Queen. I see no
particular merit in the double forms. The single whites are a godsend and,
after a few years without disturbance, they spread prettily.
Below them, at a lower height, I recommend the Gaura lindheimeri, which I
have grown to maturity in its second year from a seed packet. Probably, it
ought to be tied to a stake, but I have let my young plants fall with their
white flowers sideways, like a graceful form of willow herb. Anemones hold
themselves upright, but Gauras throw themselves around very prettily. One
danger is that a hard winter will kill them off.
At intervals beyond these two fine plants, you need spires and spikes of
white. The spires are best found on the tall veronica virginica, which has
been hidden from most of us under the new name of Veronicastrum. The spikes
are best on the Cimicifugas, whose flowers are like white bottle-brushes and
whose stems develop best in a semi-shaded bed which is not too dry. These
plants have the great advantage of being tall, up to five feet in good
conditions: neither of them is gleaming white, but they have a style which
is still under-exploited.
Beyond these leafy border plants, you need white shrubs with density and a
higher volume of flower. The robust white tree mallow, Lavatera Barnsley, is
an obvious choice nowadays wherever the garden can run slightly out of
control. Hardy white fuchsias are another possibility, often forgotten for
their ability to put up with shade. White hydrangeas are more obvious and
particularly handsome in this wet year: the best of the hardy forms is still
Mme E. Mouilliere, although the more subtle style of the Lacecap varieties
is superior.
This year, I have a new favourite, always listed but seldom seen in
thoughtful plantings, perhaps because it seems too obvious. The
white-flowered Obedient Plant is five times as good as its purple-pink
sister: its dark green leaves set off obedient stems of white flowers to a
height of about two feet. Its worst enemy is its name, Pysostegia Summer
Snow, but I like to alternate groups of it with the white Penstemon
Snowstorm, which took such a beating from its namesake last winter. At a
greater height behind them, you cannot beat the best of the phloxes, the
robust White Admiral, which flowers from July until late September, if you
remember to dead-head it. There is something special in this variety's pale
green leaf and breeding which gives it the vigour lacked by other phloxes in
the pale-colour range. Breeders ought to investigate it.
White flowers without scent would be a poor half-measure. Many people
complain that scent is almost unavailable later in the season, but they
forget their tobacco plants and are among the hundreds of gardeners who
overlook the easiest of white lilies, Lilium formosanum. If you sow seed of
this variety in January, it really will flower in the first year of its
life. It is extremely easy and is best managed if you pot it on by stages
into six or seven inch pots. In late June, they can be let into gaps left by
early varieties. Next week, they will join the last of the white tobacco
plants and will spread a strong scent through the chill of early autumn
evenings. Many town gardeners cram the lovely regale lily into pots for
July, but forget to do anything about this lovely sequel, a lily which is
happy on any good garden soil.
Lastly, I would play around with autumn crocuses. The blue varieties are
well-known, but I have a weakness for the white-flowered Crocus speciosus
albus, which soon makes a good clump in any light soil. The flowers will be
showing in mid-September, but the leaves have to wait until next spring.
Like all strong whites, they make a big impression in small, dense groups.
The battle for colour is far from over, and it merely needs a touch of
cunning to keep the flags of white still flying until frost finally forces
us all to submit.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Gardening: So sweet, but often dowdy - Daphne, a plant of
variable character
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAPHNE brings images of fragrance and unreliability, yet neither is true
entirely of the dozen or so species found commonly in gardens. In fact, it
is extraordinary how much these vary in character: some evergreen, others
deciduous, some scented very sweetly and a few not at all, or only very
slightly. And although most are beautiful, there are one or two that are
distinctly dowdy.
Two daphnes grow wild in Britain. One of them, D. mezerium, is a favourite
in gardens, especially with cottagers who seem to have the knack of growing
it well. It is fairly rare in the wild but the other native, D. laureola,
the spurge laurel, is common enough in woods on alkaline soils.
Although not exciting, D. laureola is worth a place in the wild garden for
its ability to thrive in dry shade and the limiest soils. It is a leafy
evergreen that grows from 2ft to 4ft high with curling clusters of small,
greenish-yellow flowers which sometimes are honey-scented and always appear
very early in the year - from February to April. You can scarcely go wrong
with this daphne.
You could say much the same of D. mezerium, which does grow freely in some
gardens and even spreads by seedlings which are self-sown from the handsome,
scarlet berries (which are very poisonous and usually produced freely).
The habit of the bush is distinctive with stiffly-upright stems,
lance-shaped deciduous leaves, and small purple flowers clustered close to
the stems. They are very fragrant, as are those of its beautiful, pure-white
variety.
D. mezerium is a rare, protected plant that is found wild on limey or chalky
soils, usually in woods, although generally it is grown in the open in
gardens. The difficulty with this fine plant is that it is apt to die
suddenly and without obvious cause. Cottage gardeners seem to succeed with
it, perhaps because they often let it choose its own place to grow and then
leave it alone.
Probably the best daphne with which to make a start - because it is
beautiful, likely to succeed and lives for a reasonable time - is a hybrid
named D. burkwoodii Somerset. It makes a very freely-branched bush, 3ft to
4ft high and generally a little more through, with narrow, light-green
leaves and abundant, lilac-like pink flowers that are very fragrant.
It is a semi-evergreen which likes sunny places and most reasonably
well-drained soils, with a preference for those containing lime. It flowers
in May and sometimes there is a second, smaller display early in autumn.
Daphne cneorum, known as the Farland Flower, was one of the parents of D.
burkwoodii and could be considered the most beautiful of all daphnes. There
is a pure-white variety but the natural, rose-pink type is the favourite. It
makes an evergreen, wide-spreading bush which, while only about a foot high,
can reach several feet across.
The small and sweetly-scented flowers are produced with immense freedom in
May. D. cneorum certainly likes limey soil but it grows freely in the Royal
Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley, Surrey, where the soil is sandy
and rather acid. What it does require is moisture at all times of the year
and failures, which are fairly frequent, may be due very largely to drought.
Then there is Daphne blagayana which has much larger, evergreen leaves. In
spring, there are clusters of very sweetly-scented, creamy-white flowers at
the ends of the long sprawling stems that make it very suitable for rock
gardens.
Daphne petraea is a true rock plant: a tiny, tufted evergreen rarely more
than 3in high which grows wild on inaccessible cliffs in the limestone alps
of the southern Tyrol. For the garden, there is a variety named Grandiflora
which has flowers of superior size. They are rosy-pink, sweetly-scented gems
which individually are like those of D. cneorum although the plant is, of
course, very much smaller.
Indeed, its size means it needs to be protected from slugs and other foes.
Thus, rock plant enthusiasts usually grow it in pots or pans containing
gritty, sharply-drained soil (including limestone chippings) in an unheated
greenhouse or frame. This is not an easy plant to buy but it can be obtained
from Potterton and Martin, the Cottage Nursery, Nettleton, Caistor,
Lincolnshire.
Perhaps the best smelling daphne of all is D. odora, but it is not as
free-flowering as some of the others and it is not completely hardy in all
parts of Britain, although it will survive a few degrees of frost. The
lance-shaped leaves are evergreen, quite large, and a fine, glossy hue.
There is a variety named Aurea-Marginata, with an attractive golden margin
to each leaf, which is actually a little hardier than the plain green type.
D. odora produces quite large clusters of flowers in two shades of
reddish-purple from December well into the spring (which is much too early
for safety in most British gardens). So, this is an ideal small plant for a
conservatory; but for years I grew the variegated variety successfully in my
Sussex garden against the south-facing wall of the house.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Gardening: Why the best is bound to be absent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE WEATHER has been kinder to Chelsea flower show exhibitors than in any of
the last three years. It is the first green spring for much too long and no
doubt the sights will be wonderful - both the flowers and the gardening
public in the flesh.
Certainly, garden accessories will be ever more in evidence, although I know
before I start that I will never bring myself to afford a pseudo-Victorian
greenhouse. Before we are all swept away with Marquee Madness, I would like
to put in a word for things which will not be there.
They are not only the large numbers of gardeners who cannot face
traffic-jams and do not like coaches. They are fields of unattended
buttercups, now at their best; the last of the Pheasant Eye narcissi among
cow parsley and long grass; huge lilacs bulging over urban walls; woods of
bluebells which refute the notion that our world is already warming; clouds
of flower on the best of all late-flowering cherries, the white Prunus
longipes, with blossom dangling on long stems, like cherries, fit to be worn
as earrings.
Nothing mature can be shown at Chelsea, nothing as tall as the off-white
Staphylea, which is dominating one of my local bus-stops, nor the huge bulk
of single-flowered white Rubus Benenden, the stems have such a freshness
throughout the summer. Chelsea is artificial, a suspension of disbelief.
This weekend I can still disbelieve it, especially when looking at the
daphnes in my garden.
Of all the noble families, daphnes are particularly ill-suited to
flower-shows. I have never seen a really happy daphne at Chelsea, except for
a female namesake, and I doubt if we ever shall. Right now, some of the best
forms are at their peak, but daphnes would refuse to move to a show because
their roots detest disturbance. Whatever you see next week, it will not be
fully indicative of May's best shrubs.
Over the years I have grown about a dozen varieties, killed a few of them,
and left others behind when moving house. I have tangutica progressing
slowly but healthily from cuttings; my retusa is less than one foot high and
wide after nine years; I no longer have the scented white-flowered
blagayana, which hugged the ground for five years and threw off a wonderful
sweetness until it died, as usual, before reaching middle-age.
I have had Daphne odora - both green and golden forms - in pots and under
windows, often developing those bare lower stems and rather pale buds, which
never match the bushes beside other people's doors. This golden-leaved
daphne is one of the essential plants, easily rooted from cuttings. Its
master, the late E A Bowles, once wrote that it needs 'a corner outside by
kitchen and chimney, the sort of place where the cat goes to bed and where
blue bottles sit on the wall in late autumn.' There are no flies on the cats
who visit from neighbouring gardens.
These daphnes are not all easy, but I have at last found the best for my
type of gardening, late in my progress through the family. It is not the
tall, easy Daphne Somerset which is leafy and makes a broad, unusual hedge.
It is the daphne from Naples, which reached England in the Regency era and
has behaved with quiet good sense ever since. I seldom notice it in other
gardens, except in the forecourt of Jenkyn Place, near Alton, Hampshire,
where I first woke up to its merits. It grows about two feet high; it is
completely hardy; its rather dark leaves are evergreen and vaguely reflect
light; it will grow on any soil, hot, acid or not, so long as the drainage
is sharp and the roots are free from interference. It seems to revel in
rotted pig manure, and its flowers are a muted rose-pink, which lasts for
about a month, until late May. It has a glorious scent, especially on cold
evenings.
For impact, exhibitors would probably prefer my other performer, a ruby-red
mat of flowers, which is known as Daphne Cneorum eximia. I am hesitant about
the name because all our true eximia derives from a wonder plant, owned by
the late A T Johnson, one of those rare gardening columnists who added as
much to nursery-lists as to the newspaper columns. His daphne hugs the
ground and has flowers of a rich red with a notable scent.
Some of the forms on sale seem to me to be paler than others: the
founder-parent is said to have grown to the amazing width of 6 ft. I can
almost vouch for this size on a plant in a previous garden: it grew in full
sun and the rich soil which this easy variety likes. It derived from a
cutting of a marvellous parent, still to be seen this month on the old rock
garden at Waterperry, open to the public, near Oxford.
I have never seen the Neapolitan daphne near Naples. I have never seen
Cneorum, except in the Dolomites among powder-blue alpine clematis. In the
Pyrenees, there have been reports of a plain Daphne Cneorum, which is even
more sumptuous. This weekend, I would settle for the easy eximia, one of
those scented shrubs which exhibitors may show in miniature on a table for
alpines at Chelsea, but which will never be seen on exhibition at its true
width and glory. Some of the best things in life cannot be shown off: it may
help to remember this law of nature when you struggle to see through the
crowds what exhibitors can still display at its best.

NATIVE PLANTS AND SHRUBS LOWER THE WATER BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
By using a combination of drought-tolerant native and non-native plants in the
garden, you can conserve water and still enjoy an array of color, texture,
shapes and scents unique to the region.
</P>
<P>
Summer is the time to plan, not plant.
</P>
<P>
Fall is the best time to plant native plants; the air is cool and the soil is
still warm. During the first year, more frequent watering is needed, but once
established, these plants are summer teetotalers and thrive year in and year
out.
</P>
<P>
A starter list of some popular drought-tolerant, flowering native shrubs
well-suited to the San Fernando Valley's semi-arid terrain:
</P>
<P>
* Manzanita: Attractive for its smooth, shiny elliptic green leaves and
red-brown stems. Grows to 6 feet or more on hilly landscapes. Mid-winter/early
spring yield spectacular small, waxy white flowers.
</P>
<P>
* California lilac: Large, spreading shrub with stiff, shiny branchlets and
small green leaves covered in early spring with clusters of white to pale-blue
blossoms.
</P>
<P>
* Buckwheat: Native to chaparral. Grows up to 8 feet in height, depending on
species. Clouds of pale yellow, pink, white or red flowers bloom into summer.
</P>
<P>
* Nevin's barberry: Saved from extinction in the wilds of the Valley by the
Theodore Payne Foundation. Native dense shrub valuable for distinct bluish
foliage and yellow flowers followed by reddish berries in late summer. Arching
branches that reach to the ground are useful as a hedge and bird sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
* Currant: Small, pinkish spring flowers. Tolerates drought, but loves oak tree
shade. Currants are edible in syrups and pies if sweetened.FRANN BART

FT  05 MAR 94 / Gardening: The scent that says spring - How can the
sweet-smelling mimosa be grown successfully in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout the week there have been definite signs of spring, but they mean
different things in different countries.
In Britain, they mean the best of the crocuses, emergent flower on
brown-leaved Prunus and lengthening beads of flower on my particular
favourite among yellow-flowered shrubs, the Stachyurus.
Roses have started into leaf and if you want to ward off black spot, you
must start to spray now, using Nimrod T once a fortnight on the young
leaves. Delay, and you have lost the war.
Who has cared about black spot this week on a latitude below Europe's fog
belt? I have been in the right place at the right time.
It has been shirt-sleeves only outside San Spirito; Primavera has stepped
out of Botticelli's painting; no-one is pining by the Arno; there have been
angels at large in Florence and, on the track of Fra Angelicos, I found
something heavenly. Along the Borgo Pinto, the houses open on to courtyards.
Just before Perugino's Crucifixion, spring met me head on in clouds of
yellow, pink and satin-red flowers.
We will soon have our pink-flowered almonds in the UK and already, there are
satin-red buds on the japonicas. The yellow is denied to us.
In florists throughout London you can buy a few sprigs of mimosa. In
Florence, there are huge trees of it, flowering as thickly as those Banksian
roses which are next month's glory in southern Spain.
Mimosa, not tax, may yet drive me offshore.
Expatriates gloat among it over breakfast on the Riviera. Florentine
flat-dwellers look on to trees of it beside branches of the almond blossom
which are picked and displayed on the counters of flower-conscious shops.
In their great Italian city, we all complain about our fellow-tourists, but
we ought to remember what we owe to botanical immigrants. If the great men
of the past could return, they would be amazed by the present
Mediterra-nean.
The Greeks knew no eucalyptus and the Romans knew no orange trees in
Andalucia. Botticelli never saw mimosa, nor did the English Grand Tourists
who visited the Uffizi and idealised its naked statue of Venus without
bothering to look at the paintings which now amaze us.
Mimosa arrived in the 1820s, the Antipodes' postscript to old European art.
Of course Masaccio's frescoes are memorable, but a full-flowering tree of
mimosa measures up to him, as yellow as the robes of the youthful St John. I
have never expected that a prime site in Florence would be Austra-lian.
How can we grow mimosa in Britain? Only once have I seen it luxuriate, in
the great Irish garden of Glen Veagh in County Donegal. Its lavish American
owner would advance on the trees with his personalised secateurs and clip
the branches with suitable throw-away comments before handing them to his
guests.
Derbyshire is not County Donegal and you cannot grow a mimosa outdoors in
most of Britain's climate. In warm areas, it will survive by the Gulf
Stream, in Devon or even in especially sheltered parts of London.
It is happiest on a wall, but it never flowers as freely as I have now seen
it: the reason, I think, is not so much the risk of frost as its need to be
thoroughly ripened by sun in summer.
In Britain, the best place for the best varieties is a conservatory or cool
greenhouse.
Under cover mimosas need little more heat than suffices to keep out frost in
winter: they will grow best in a bed with room for their roots, but most of
them will try to touch the skies if they are happy. The hardiest forms have
been recorded at heights of 100ft in wild Australia.
Unless you have a glass castle, you should confine your plant in a large pot
and prune it heavily after flowering. The main reason why indoor mimosas
flower half-heartedly is that they are allowed to become too dry at the root
in winter.
Stand them so that you can water freely from below and try not to choose the
more boring varieties. Mimosas are correctly listed as Acacias nowadays.
A big selection is still offered by Burncoose Nurseries, at Redruth, in
Cornwall and their small plants will grow away quickly.
The best is baileyana which comes from New South Wales and is distinguished
by its silvery-blue leaf, an exceptionally pretty feature.
On a wall, the silvery pravissima arches into a good shape and is too little
known: up a pillar in a conservatory, you would also enjoy riceana which is
named after a chancellor of the exchequer but as he died long ago, you need
not hold the name against it.
In Australia, these wonderful trees are known as Wattles: Silver Wattles,
Oven Wattles, Rice's Wattle until you wonder wattle turn up next.
In Britain, we all know them as mimosa, grouping them with those similar
sensitive plants which curl up their leaves when you touch them or brush
against them while sheltering underneath.
Their sensitive habits mimic sensitive humans and so, I suppose, they began
to be known as mimosas because of their mimicry.
Personally, I love the scent. Imitate the Florentines and, if you cannot
join them, at least compete by growing your own mimosa in a pot for cut
flowers and that exquisite scent of warm Italy.

PLANT OF THE WEEK

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Up to a foot long, the trumpet-shaped flowers of Brugmansia are the plant's
main attraction: Nodding or pendulous, hanging like ornaments from tree-like or
bushy shrubs, they are almost intoxicatingly fragrant at nightfall. The large,
oblong leaves seem to pale in comparison and will get more sparse the colder
the weather (Brugmansia is damaged by frost but will survive at 25 degrees).
</P>
<P>
But Brugmansia can bloom all year: About two weeks ago, at the State and Los
Angeles County Arboretum in Arcadia, Brugmansia cultivar "Charles Grimaldi" was
blooming with golden flowers. (You can also see B. versicolor, with pale pink
flowers, and the B. suaveolens, white, at the arboretum.) Specimens can also be
seen in a wild, overgrown setting at the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San
Marino, and at the Hortense Miller garden in Laguna Beach.
</P>
<P>
Now for the downside: All parts of Brugmansia -- the roots, leaves, flowers --
are highly poisonous. Taxonomists first placed these plants in the same genus
as Datura, of which the extremely toxic jimson weed is a member, but then
renamed the larger, tree-like Datura to Brugmansia because of their size. (In
certain books and in the nurseries, Brugmansia may still be named Datura.)
</P>
<P>
The Brugmansia species candida, arborea, suaveolens and aurea are frequently
crossed, so that many colors and shapes of flowers are available. Flowers can
be simply bell-shaped, more tubular and even double in form. Colors include
salmon, red, apricot, yellow, white and pale pink. Some open up white and then
start to take on their color. Most last about three days.
</P>
<P>
Brugmansia grows 10 to 20 feet tall. Shrub-like in habit, it can be trained as
a small tree as well. Usually given a dominant position in the landscape, it
should be allowed plenty of room because of its large root system.
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing as it is, it can be encouraged with extra water and fertilizer.
Full sun or shade is fine as long as the plant is protected from wind. In
sunnier locations, it needs more water. In very hot weather, the plant will
wilt; to revive, give it water. But overall, Brugmansia likes a cool and moist
environment, much like its native land, the mountains of South America.
</P>
<P>
Pests include spider mites and cutworms. Richard Moriarty of Green Systems
International, a Southern California grower of Brugmansia, recommends monthly

<DESCRIPT>  PLANT; AUSTRALIA; NAME; LIST  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THERE are so many excellent Australian plants it is hard to choose among them.
Here's a list of 12 Aussies chosen after a tour of the Slosson Gardens and
consultation with arboretum manager Brett Hall. The plants below are
beautiful, reliable and reasonably easy to grow. All survived the December
freeze -- if frozen back, they are sprouting again from their roots.;    (box)
GREVILLEAS: Plants range from ground covers to small trees 40 feet high. Robin
Gordon has striking bright red flowers, is easy to grow, and blooms year-round
at Slosson Gardens. Full of nectar, the blossoms attract hummingbirds.
Although frozen in the December freeze, it is returning from the roots.
Another outstanding choice is Grevillea lavandulacea, a pink-flowered variety
with several forms. Billy Wing is low-growing. Tanunda has gray foliage.
Grevillea lavandulacea is a spreading ground cover with holly-like leaves and
orange-red flowers that survived the frost nicely.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (box) KUNZEAS: Outstanding is Kunzea parvifolia, a three-foot spreading
mound of lavender blossoms that "sailed through the frost," says Hall, even in
"Frost Hollow," a low area where temperatures dropped to 14 degrees.;    (box)
HIBBERTIAS: There are approximately 100 hibbertias in Australia, all with
yellow or orange blossoms. Slosson Gardens has 40 of them, ranging from ground
covers to small shrubs. With bright, clear yellow blossoms, ground-hugging
Hibbertia pedunculata is a choice plant for a rock garden or container. It
proved frost-hardy last December.;    (box) CALLISTEMONS: The most commonly
planted bottle brush is the bright red Callistemon citrinus, but there are
many other choices, ranging from ground covers to tree height. Kings Park
Special is a graceful red-flowered variety with pendulous branches, growing to
10 feet high and 8 feet wide. Callistemon pallidus is a yellow-flowered form
reaching 7 feet high and 8 feet wide.;    (box) BANKSIAS: There are several
good garden species among these striking plants, which are members of the
Protea family. Banksia marginata is a tall beauty with yellow flowers. Banksia
ericofolia is readily available and highly adaptable. In Australia, it ranges
from Queensland to Victoria, sand heaps to mountains, and lives up to 20
years. Banksia repens, or Creeping Banksia, is an interesting ground cover.
Salmon-colored Banksia burdettii is good for cut flowers but frost-sensitive.;
   (box) LEPTOSPERMUMS: Also called Tea Tree, these plants are already
familiar to Western gardeners, but there are many more choices than those
commonly used. Leptospermum rotundifolium has large flowers ranging in color
from pink to lavender and is very drought tolerant. Leptospermum brevipes has
several forms, including a burgundy-foliaged form with a narrow columnar shape
that looks nice against buildings. It has white flowers and woody fruits.
There are weeping forms too.;    (box) CALYTRIXES: These are enchanting
myrtles from southeast Australia. Calytrix tetragona is a real showoff in
bright pink. The flowers are long lasting as well as showy. It reaches 3 to 4
feet tall and 5 feet wide.;    (box) PROSANTHERAS: An old clone long used in
Australian gardens is or Rosea, also called incense bush. It has a minty
smell, rose pink flowers and grows three to four feet tall. Another form is
Glen Davis, with dark purple flowers, which grows to 10 feet.;    (box)
CORREAS. The variety Correa pulchella has pink and orange forms. It does well
in shade and fog belts, producing pendulous flowers mostly in winter and early
spring. Dusky Rose is another popular cultivar.;    (box) DAMPIERAS: These
low-growing plants have flowers of eye-popping blues. The variety Dampiera
diversifolia, now available in the trade, spreads by putting out shoots. Some
froze in December, but are shooting back from the base.;    (box)
MICROMERTISES: "Really dazzling" is Hall's description of Micromertis ciliate,
good in rockeries and a great plant to cascade down a bank. It has pink buds,
white flowers and red seed pods.;    (box) EUCALYPTUS: It would hardly do to
write about Australian plants without mentioning the eucalyptus, almost a
trademark of the land down under. The big, messy Blue Gum is to be avoided,
but a handsome choice for a garden tree is Eucalyptus paucifolia or Snow Gum.
It has a nice white trunk, and, as the tree that grows at the highest
elevation in the Australian mountains, is super frost-hardy. The December
freeze didn't bother it at all. Notable for its bright yellow flowers is
Eucalyptus preissiana, one of the mallees -- shrubby eucalypts grown mostly
for their flowers.  </TEXT>

FT  11 JAN 92 / Gardening: This is the year for planting heavy metal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO DATE, this year's weather has claimed no casualties in the garden: some
of the half-hardy plants are still with us, an unexpected setting for 1992.
In this dry spell, my plans for the year are ambitious, a short cut to early
arthritis.
I want new flower beds, new plantings, new hedging experiments and swathes
of garden where at present there is only muddle.
The experiments are straightforward, but they need some lengths of heavy
metal. Three years ago, I planted a young yew hedge during one of the dry
spring seasons. The soil is stony everywhere, but especially stony where the
yews have to sit: it was hard enough to plant them in holes of friendly
compost and it would have been even harder to put in a barrier to contain
their hungry roots. It seemed cruel to both of us to block them in at any
depth during dry weather. Like the yews, my plans have grown and I have to
correct this short-cut.
In front of the hedge, I want a new border. I do not merely want it: I have
made it and one end is already planted with the recurrent pink rose Jacques
Cartier, a modern Dianthus called Widdecombe Fair and a promising small
sorbus called koehneana which has white berries.
If you want a proper flower bed in front of a yew hedge, you have to curb
the hedge's roots because they will exhaust the soil. The best method is to
take some strips of corrugated sheeting from a rubbish tip or unwanted shed
and bury them about two feet from the yews to a depth of two or three feet.
The yews will grow strongly, but they will be unable to penetrate the border
in front of them. You will realise your photographic dream, a border of
flowers against an ideal background of dark, living green.
Further along, I also want a hedge of roses. They too, need a heavy metal
treatment. Their great vice is that they go bare at the base unless they are
tied down to a length of plain wire, set just above ground level and
stretched tightly between metal uprights. Several of the best old-fashioned
roses will then make a thick hedge if they are planted about three feet
apart and their shoots are stretched ruthlessly sideways on a low wire as
soon as they are planted.
Once again, I have a local boulder problem, but my present plan is to wire
up an old Edwardian beauty called Mrs John Laing and enjoy her continuous
roses of strong pink in a hedge of wires, broken up by small standard
Pteleas, round-headed trees with scented flowers. Expect reports on
progress: the likeliest enemy is the usual black spot which affects roses on
my light soil.
Elsewhere, my plans are for permanencies which ought to have been finalised
three years ago. One of the consequences of making a new garden is the
realisation that the principled advice of books is seldom obeyed in
practice. Authors always tell us to place the long-term features first, but
new ideas intrude and new possibilities emerge as the site is progressively
tamed.
I have long-term designs on a low sweet-scented hedge of sarcocca which
flowers in winter. I want to imitate the wooden pergolas in the French rose
garden at Bagatelle; I want a serious Magnolia which will survive on lime in
the Cotswolds and allow its flowers to hang down like lids on a rare white
dish. The likeliest candidate seems to be Magnolia Wilsonii, which is said
to tolerate lime and is selling locally at a decent height for only Pounds
10.
These features would all have been better placed three years ago, but I had
not realised that I wanted them. It is the same story with one edge of the
lawn which runs into rough grass under trees and now badly needs a garden in
keeping with the rest of the design.
Nothing will happen in 1992 to change my non-green approach to clearing a
wilderness. There is no substitute for sensible use of a weedkiller which
does not affect the structure of the soil: I use Round-up, because it is the
strongest form of killer with glyphosate on the market. On a site which has
been rounded up, I can then think of gardening, beginning with hellebores in
February, flowering Ribes in spring and then forms of shade-tolerant rose
alba in high summer and cyclamen for autumn.
There will also be more room for my latest little-known weapon. In the 17th
century, the double-flowered forms of our native Soapwort were popular in
gardens, but you have to hunt for them hard in your Plantfinder nowadays
under Saponaria. In 1989 I acquired a tiny scrap of the old double white
form. By 1990, it had run all over the place, killing a nearby daphne and
asking to be moved out of a special flower bed as soon as possible. It
belongs in a wild setting where it will spread happily, and continue to
produce double white flowers about a foot high from July until the frosts.
On cool days and in the evening its scent spreads wonderfully, sweet and
rich in an unexpected way. It is much too strong for a small flower bed but
it will be my nap for 1992, weed-proof in a border at that awkward point
where mown grass runs into the undergrowth of trees.

<HEAD>Hawke Tearfully Admits To Adultery On National Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an extraordinary public confession,
Prime Minister Bob Hawke tearfully admitted to a national TV
audience Tuesday he had been unfaithful to his wife of 33 years.
   Hawke made the admission in a taped interview on Channel 7's
Newsworld program that was to be aired Tuesday night. The network
and the Prime Minister's Office released a transcript of the
interview.
   Hawke, 59, acknowledged reports of his womanizing, saying it was
in the past. He pledged his love for his wife, Hazel, calling her an
``incredible woman.''
   Newspapers led their front pages with the story. The Sydney
Morning Herald headlined: ``Bob Hawke In Tears: How I Cheated On
Hazel'' and the Daily Mirror of Sydney read: ```I Was Unfaithful To
Hazel,' PM's Amazing TV Admission.''
   The last time Hawke broke down on television was when he referred
in 1984 to drug problems among members of his family. Mrs. Hawke
later went on television to explain that their daughter, Roslyn, and
her husband, Matt, had been treated for heroin addiction.
   A spokesman for Hawke said Tuesday's admission was not new. ``All
this has been said before,'' said the official, who is not allowed
to be named.
   Hawke has said he will seek a record fourth term as prime
minister.
   In the interview, Hawke was asked what people mean when they
accuse him of being a womanizer.
   ``They mean I was unfaithful to my wife,'' Hawke replied.
   Robertson: ``Is that true?''
   Hawke: ``Yes.''
   Robertson: ``Did you stop that?''
   ``Yes,'' Hawke replied in tears, and then, ``I guess there are
not many women who would have put up with me all that time. But my
love for her never changes. I have always loved Hazel, always will.''
   Hawke also referred to his past drinking, which his biographer
Blanche d'Alpuget says earned him an entry in the Guiness Book of
World Records when he drank two and a half pints of beer in 12
seconds while studying at Oxford University in Britain. Hawke quit
drinking in 1979.

Peter Austen, 40, finance and planning manager of RHM's cereals division,
has taken over as finance director of Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the musical
instrument maker and music publisher.
Austen is replacing Paul Hazel, 42, who quit after five years in the job.
Richard Holland, Boosey's chairman, said that Hazel had left for personal
reasons and dismissed suggestions that there had been any personality clash.
Hazel, who earned Pounds 147,893 last year, was the highest-paid director.
Austen qualified with Ernst &amp; Young in 1981. He subsequently joined the
group finance department of Rank Hovis McDougall, becoming group chief
accountant in 1985.

resigned after five years in the job.
The company, which is majority owned by Carl Fischer, a private US music

company in June 1989 from Brent Chemicals International, filling a vacancy
caused by Richard Holland's promotion to chief executive.
Boosey &amp; Hawkes's fortunes have recovered strongly since 1986, when it was
the subject of an unwelcome Pounds 9.8m takeover bid.
It has returned to profit and its market capitalisation has grown more than
six fold to Pounds 66m. It reports its interim results in October.

FT  26 NOV 94 / Gardening: Blankets for the beds in winter - How to deal
with semi-hardy plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month has proved remarkably mild in the south of England and a hard
winter still seems a distant possibility. The ceanothusis are back in bud;
evergreen choisysas are having a second flowering; and, out of doors, the
fuchsias have still stopped. It is strange to be picking small bunches of
roses when the larch trees have finally turned into the countryside's last
burst of yellow.
But take no chances and believe no signs of kindness: mother nature can be
cruel and I do not trust her to behave herself from this weekend onwards.
Any misbehaviour is hurtful to gardeners because we are all growing more
semi-hardy plants than we used to 20 years ago. They multiply easily for the
many small nurseries which have arisen since 1985. They look clean and fresh
in late spring - exactly what supermarket shoppers now expect from plants.
And they transform gardening in pots and small urban spaces.
Since 1981-1982, we have not had the sort of winter which makes us all
swear, briefly, never again. In normal winters salvation can come in
different forms. Here are the options (doing nothing is not one of them  -
and doing everything is pointless).
Perhaps the geraniums are still flowering, but you are very lucky because
they ought to have died weeks ago. Most of next season's half-hardy plants
for pots will be much better if they are grown afresh as newly-rooted
cuttings in 1995. All of my personal favourites are better thrown away,
except for one or two parent plants from which cutting should be taken early
next year of young growth which is being brought on under slight heat.
Plants such as verbena, heliotrope, pelargoniums and penstemons will flower
less freely from their second year onwards. All you need to keep is a
parent, or perhaps two, to cover yourself against disaster. The others might
as well be thrown away.
The only exceptions are plants grown for their leaves. Here, the lovely
forms of scented geraniums are admirable companions during winter inside the
house. Trim them slightly at the tips of their stems to stop them becoming
straggly, but save as many as you like because they improve with age. So
does the widely-grown Helichrysum petiolatum with its felted grey leaves. It
is worth training one or two plants in a large pot where they can be clipped
and trained into mounds of grey leaves on a framework of arched wire from
one season to the next.
Otherwise, the plants which you lift can be clipped hard - very hard if they
are tender geraniums which will otherwise become too leggy.
For safe storage, they do not only need a place where the temperature will
not fall below freezing. They also need light and air. In this mild spell,
the dangers have been mould and mildew, especially on anything which was
lifted with flowers and leaves waiting to turn brown.
Many of my soft plants begin the winter in a frost-proof shed, which is only
frost-proof if the door is kept firmly shut. Closure encourages mildew,
especially if you overwater. Remember to open the door on mild days and try
not to water too often when your plants are only ticking over. Once every 10
days is usually quite enough.
Perhaps this lifting sounds too energetic and you are short of storage. On
the margins of hardiness, you have another option - leave the plants outside
and wrap them in a suitable blanket.
A mound of bracken used to be the best answer but the business has changed -
even though though most of the gardening books do not acknowledge it.
Instead of bracken and rotted leaves, we can all use artificial blankets.
The best of them allow water to seep through, avoiding the dryness which
bracken usually causes. They take the edge off cold wind and mitigate the
sharpness of an average frost. After three year's experimenting, I now swear
by them and reckon that we all have more to learn about their possibilities.
To the trade, they are known as crop covers and are most familiar when
protecting early vegetables and seedlings. Garden centres now sell the
lighter grades of blanket in small pieces for gardeners with a plant or two
to be protected.
These fibres and fleeces are helpful, but they are not as heavy as I would
like for serious defence of big shrubs and soft summer-flowering plants.
This year I am following up my researches at the summer flower shows and
opting for the Envirofleece made by Agralan. Their blankets are heavyweights
on wide rolls and trade discounts should apply to those of you who need 100m
lengths at a time.
Two new weights in this brand are the Agralan Envirofleece 30 which is a
medium grade for small shrubs, half-hardy border plants and things such as
salvias throughout the winter, and the Envirofleece 60, a heavier grade for
large shrubs and climbers.
Both these fleeces are made from polypropylene and are easily pinned round
and in front of the plants whose hardiness causes you most worry.
But why bother, when a really heavy frost will have its way regardless? From
my experiments in recent winters, I have found that it is worth the modest
expense and effort. In generally mild winters there have been a few short
sharp shocks sufficient to knock out unprotected marginals such as Hebe
hulkeana, the taller daisy-flowered osteospermums and the tender forms of
salvia and diascia.
Those which I wrapped in lightweight fibre-blankets had survived when I
unwrapped them in April. Their unsheltered neighbours were stone dead, as
usual. No doubt a really ferocious winter will go through your Envirofleece
and be as lethal as ever, but these gentler seasons have certainly been
abated by these new protections.
The trouble is that most of them come in an intrusive shade of fleecy white
which then turns dirty grey like a sheep in a wet November. Agralan have
introduced a pale green medium fleece which takes the edge off the eyesore
and is adequate for smaller shrubs.
By lifting a few parents and blanketing the best of the rest, it should be
possible to avoid the casualties which disfigured gardens in the 1970s and
1980s.
Every pest is quick to outwit the latest predator and no doubt, mother
nature will hit us with a really hard one just when I think that I have
blanketed her out.
Until she does, fleece the plants at risk during the next few weekends; peg
the blankets down or weight them into place with stones before the winter
fleeces the plants from you instead.

FT  14 NOV 92 / Gardening: Wild and wet November reveals its glories - Robin
Lane Fox has been picking all the flowers he can lay his hands on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOON has been scudding wildly above the spires of Oxford; everything is
once more remarkable and received wisdom is being turned upside down by its
light.
In mid-November gardeners are supposed to be losing heart. If you believe
what you read, you should be returning to gloom, cutting down the borders
and wondering how to aerate the lawn. Nobody has a kind word for the season
until it is time to write about catalogues. This year, however, the school
of garden gloom has got it all wrong.
Naturally, FT readers do not believe all they read: go out there and check
it, take the scissors and look carefully. Gloom is not the word for it. The
past fortnight has been wonderfully mild and wet, providing us with pleasure
which I last remember on such a scale in 1976.
Spring-flowering plants, late flowering climbers and shrubs which ought to
know better are opening their buds and still showing colour.
The primroses are enjoying a postscript; violas are ignoring the calendar;
many of the roses have new buds long after the season. According to the
books, the only certain flowers for every gardener in November are universal
pansies. Pansies may be creeping up on us, but these late encores in a
garden are an opportunity.
Wherever you see flowers or colour, cut them and bring them indoors.
Inhibitions are irrelevant. During the high summer, I pick flowers with
restraint, absurdly anxious that I will leave a noticeable gap if I take too
much from the main plantings.
I hold back, tell myself to economise among profusion and never take an
unopened bud. In November, the game is quite different. Flower-picking
becomes like shoplifting when the windows hav been smashed and the
government has fled.
Whatever you leave behind, nature will soon take it instead, sending frost
or a storm to ruin it. For some weeks now, the weather has been as
changeable as the high seas so nothing can be risked or left to its mercy.
Whatever flowers appear end up inside the house: I have even been picking my
best successes of this autumn, the pink schizostylis which open wonderfully
if the stems are picked in bud.
From the window, all may look ravaged, quite unlike the experience which I
am reporting. Look closely, and you will be amazed what is lurking among the
leaves. In less than an hour, I have picked some crazy mixtures of spring
and autumn, pinks, blues, whites against a backing of the pearl-pink berries
which are better than ever on the sorbus trees.
In November, a ceanothus has no right to be covered in buds, but the last
fortnight has brought my Trewithen Blue into yet another covering of
flowers. This variety continues to grow furiously up an exposed south wall
but these flowers are best taken indoors before November remembers its bad
manner. I have been relishing the paradox of these blue flowers from spring
among the first scented mahonias of winter, sprigs of the tireless winter
Cherry and some faded buds from Rose New Dawn.
Rosebuds are wonderfully suited to late picking because they will open fully
in a warm room if picked with the faintest flush of colour. Indoors, heating
does the work of summer: I find that my favourite apricot-yellow climber,
Lady Hillingdon, is second to none for its late scattering of buds which can
be brought on under shelter.
At this late season, whoever would expect pinks and double primroses,
spring-flowering viburnas, perennial wallflowers, clouds of the low-growing
gypsophila or yellow potentilla in its herbaceous form called recta? The
old-fashioned pinks have gone on strike, but the newer hybrids from the West
Country are flowering on and on as if in answer to those who find their too
formal or too bright.
Pale peach flowers on the Cranmere Pool variety have lasted indoors for more
than a week among great bunches of double lilac. The admirable small
perahades have never stopped flowering in their charming shades of sky-blue
and white. Their small evergreen bushes make a pleasant edging for low
borders, although nobody seems to exploit their quality. With me, they have
survived all frosts in the last five years
Spring-flowering Viburnums in November are a supreme conceit, yet they are
showing this year while their autumn relations are flowering madly in
pepper-scented shades of pink and white. Heads of Viburnum carlesii smells
even better in November among small bunches of musk roses, pink Selicia or
the white Prosperity.
As the air is so cold, the scents of these flowers are far stronger than in
July. As backing, I have been using the clouds of tiny white daisies on the
connoisseurs' favourite low-growing Aster, the one called laterifolius
Prince the dark little leaves of which are notable throughout the summer.
The connoisseurs' oldie among chrysanthemums has also come into its own.
Pink flowered Emperor of China won a first class certificate as long ago as
1889, but nowadays critical gardeners may well wonder why. The leaves turn
to a strong beetroot red, but the flowers are small and spidery and the
bushes are thin and straggly, whatever the conservation plantspeople like to
claim in their favour.
At the last of this season's flower shows even the nurserymen could not show
this old variety in any better shape. The answer is to pick it, not show it.
Small vases of its pale pink flowers have the hazy delicacy of a Fantin
Latour painting. Buy it for this purpose and put it out of the main
sightline where you can ignore it until its mid-November picking.
Indoors, these details show up and individuality can be loved. Outdoors,
November's 'antis' do have a point. This year, the young wallflowers are
almost all of a miserable size for bedding. Because the cold and wet weather
hit them at just the wrong point in the summer. Accompanying flowerbulbs
have now soared by 15 per cent in price to cope with the pound's collapse in
Holland during this planting season. Spring bedding has never been so
expensive, but late autumn budding has never been better. Adjust to
November's encores, pick them without mercy and if it does not freeze all
winter, we will need far fewer of those hyacinths at ever higher prices.

FT  09 MAY 92 / Gardening: Westward hoe] In search of new plants and ideas -
Robin Lane Fox loses himself exploring the gardens of the Worcester triangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDENERS are enjoying their best spring for years; everything looks green
and happy; lilacs are already in flower and this years' edition of The Plant
Finder has just come out to join them. To celebrate it, I have taken a break
from preventive poisoning: heading west looking for ideas on what we could
all be growing. Westwards towards Worcestershire, there are ideas by the
dozen, some of which are easier to accommodate than others. Yellow Alyssum
is too harsh for my taste, but there might be possibilities in imitating red
Darwin tulips in grass, while the blossom on the apple trees should cause us
all to regret those which had to be grubbed out soon after we entered the
EC.
Near Malvern, there is the best selection of Michaelmas daisies in any
nursery in the country; at Kingswynford near Kidderminster, there are the
best Lewisias; near Tewkesbury (WHoo in The Plant Finder) there is a list of
admirably grown Alpines within vibration-range of the town's dual
carriageway; they are so fairly priced that most were bought months ago. All
in all, patient plant finders could be lost for days in the
Gloucester-Worcestershire triangle. My taste has learned most from one of my
favourite hunting-grounds, the walled garden and nursery at Stone House
Cottage, Stone, near Kidderminster.
This small nursery is no longer a stranger to connoisseurs. Its mastermind
is Louisa Arbuthnot, and when I wrote about her enterprise six years ago,
the article managed to sing her praises as the skilled keeper of several
thousand pets. The 'pets' should have been 'pots,' but this unsolicited
credit has not stopped the nursery from widening its clientele or the
proprietors from adding a fifth baby to their family. They continue to
propagate, criticise and supply a huge range of plants with a highly
personal labelling system.
The enterprise depends on an exceptionally sharp-eyed wife, a reassuringly
informed husband and no more than one willing assistant. This time I have
returned with young plants of a rare Oriental buddleia, collected by a keen
woman amateur gardener from the Great Wall of China when tourism was still
politically defensible.
A grey-leaved and pink-flowered variety, it has proved quite hardy and ought
to be an apt choice for my own local wall against barbarism: the ancient
city wall of Oxford, which stands in my college gardens.
The nursery supplies visitors only, but I am not trying to tantalise you by
writing merely about a source off the beaten track. Stone House Cottage has
a second string to its bow. The owners planted many of their nursery's plant
in their adjacent walled garden and, as they have lived there for some 20
years, the garden has become a living lesson.
It alerts you to the potential of plants which are otherwise names in a
list, by showing them off at maturity. The setting is not so grand that it
is inimitable.
This weekend, beds at the foot of the walls have white-flowered Bleeding
Heart, the last of the tulips and a rare Blue Eyed Mary which has little
blue flowers starred with white. Pink and yellow Epimediums keep company
with some exceptional rarities, none finer than a plant of Corydalis
Flexuosa. This lovely variety was introduced after an Oriental field-trip
and was already the talks of experts in the lunch-tent at last year's
Chelsea flower show. I now see why. This one plant was smothered in a flock
of crested flowers in an electric shade of blue which outclasses anything
except spring gentians.
Such rarities are beyond most of us, but the shrubs and wall-plants are
another matter. Many of you know or grow the pale yellow flowers of Rose
Canary Bird which is so good in a pot or tub. On Stone House Cottage's wall,
I was attracted once by a deeper and richer variety. It turned out to be
Rose Helen Knight which was bred in the late 1960s and is not related to
Canary Bird at all.
Its parents are a wild yellow rose from Afghanistan, and a plain Scots
Burnet variety. Its breeder, Frank Knight, thought highly of it, but
gardeners have been slower to follow his judgment. If you see a mature
plant, you realise at once that it is a winner. It is located against the
clashing red leaves of a young Pieris in its Worcestershire setting.
Starting from scratch, it would be good in a pot or against a wallat a
height of 5 ft, even in semi-shaded conditions.
Like Rose Canary Bird, the usual forms of Flowering Currant or Ribes are
very well known. One form, however, is more like a flowering gooseberry, the
prickly ribes speciosum. Its crimson-red flowers hang downwards from the
branches and are hardier when trained against a sunny wall. At a flower
show, young plants look ever so slightly boring. At maturity, it is quite
different: after eight years or so, it is looking its best in its
Worcestershire setting.
So has a white-flowered white lilac with a touch of ink-blue to its single
petals. In Oxford's Botanic Garden, Syringa persica alba is trained
vertically up a wall where it flowers very freely. In the walled nursery
garden, this lilac bulges forward at a lower height, not far from tall
pink-flowered Syringa microphylla, one of the great repeat-flowerers in the
family. Together they remind you that large-flowered hybrid lilacs do not
have things all their own way in May.
Established gardens also reassure those of us who are not so far down a new
garden's path. They show you small daphne retusa after 10 years or a
daphniphyllum looking its best; they prove to you that Sycopsis is not just
a suitable name for another dark green shrub with tediously small flowers.
They also show you that one day, too, your own choices will make the grade.
A mainstay of my own newish plantings is the scented white Viburnum
carlcephalum. Since planting it, I have read criticisms of it because it is
less refined than the less vigorous varieties such as Carlesii. Its choice
cost me hours of uncertainty, but I wanted a good grower which could be
pruned gradually into an upright bush like a small standard tree above low
carpets of small hardy plants.
Will the carlcephalum agree to be clipped and grow upwards not outwards?
Books never give the answer, and my young bushes are already bulging
sideways with huge crops of the big scented flowers.
At Stone House Cottage, a much older bush has reached just the height and
shape I have envisaged. Returning home, I have seen a dozen new names at
their mature best, but I have also seen evidence that a bet on the future is
really going to work.

OIL-FREE COSMETICS AND MAKEUP SAVVY HELP ADULTS HIDE ACNE BLEMISHES

I FIGURED I'd have acne until I was 19, not 36," says a film industry executive
who makes monthly visits to her dermatologist. Many people think acne plagues
only teen-agers. But Southern California dermatologists report that at least
25% of their patients who are troubled by acne are women over 30.
</P>
<P>
While there is no cure for acne, it can be controlled with creams and lotions
containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid or sulfur and, for more serious
cases, Retin-A and antibiotics. Many dermatologists offer their own skin-care
products for acne-ridden skin. Yet, even the most advanced medical care won't
clear up a complexion overnight, so camouflage makeup is necessary.
</P>
<P>
In Beverly Hills, makeup artist Valerie Sarnelle has celebrity clients, but she
also caters to patients with skin problems. In fact, she gets almost as many
referrals from dermatologists as from plastic surgeons. "Women want to know how
to hide their acne breakouts without making them worse, and the doctors want to
be sure that cosmetics are not going to aggravate the problem," says Sarnelle,
owner of Valerie's Cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
To disguise acne, Sarnelle uses an oil-free primer -- yellow for pale to medium
complexions and green for darker skin -- to reduce redness and balance skin
tones. Taking a bit of yellow liquid from a bottle, she sponges it onto a
client's face. Then with the tip of a makeup sponge, she applies a foundation
that she has formulated for oily skin. Sarnelle suggests selecting makeup one
shade darker than the natural tone to further conceal blemishes. An oil-free
makeup she stocks also provides SPF 15 protection because people who use
Retin-A are sensitive to the sun.
</P>
<P>
Makeup specialist Judith August, who sells camouflage cosmetics by mail-order
from her Studio City offices, says that many of the techniques used on women
recovering from plastic surgery can be used on acne patients. For complete
coverage, August pats on natural-tone foundation, allows it to dry and then
sponges on a second layer. August urges clients to then use powder "because it
cuts light reflection that calls attention to the blemishes." She also
recommends a flesh-toned kohl pencil for touch-ups.
</P>
<P>
When clients with acne turn to Eugenia Weston at her Senna Cosmetiques salon in
Tarzana, Weston, before applying foundation, dabs on a liquid containing
camphor, an ingredient present in some acne preparations, to "protect the skin
and dry out the blemishes." She uses matte charcoal or brown eye makeup and red
lipstick to call attention to the eyes and mouth "so the skin is not the focus
of the face."
</P>
<P>
Camouflage techniques are fine "as long as the cosmetics are labeled 'oil-free'
-- not just 'water-based' because some of those have oil -- and
'non-comedogenic,' meaning they aren't supposed to cause blemishes," explains
Dr. Lorrie Klein, an assistant clinical professor at UC-Irvine Medical Center
and a dermatologist in Laguna Niguel. And Dr. Letantia Bussell, a Beverly Hills
dermatologist, cautions against using a makeup sponge more than once.
"Organisms can go back and forth between the makeup and the face, irritating
and prolonging the breakouts," Bussell says. "Throw away the sponges after
every use, use cotton balls instead of powder puffs, and clean brushes daily
with alcohol or witch hazel."
</P>
<P>
Noting that even she breaks out, Sarnelle says: "No woman wants to admit to
having acne. But you can't hide when you have pimples, so you've got to hide
the pimples."

FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Warner Howard up 16% and sees further
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warner Howard, the hot air hand dryer and laundry equipment company,
overcame a 4 per cent decline in turnover to report its eighth consecutive
year of profits growth with a 16 per cent advance at the pre-tax level.
Mr Ernie Hazell, managing director, said he was confident the current year
would show further growth. The rate of business failures, which hit the
group hard in 1993, had slowed noticeably in recent months.
The final dividend 'which is a sign of that confidence' is increased by 15
per cent to 5.04p, for a total 12 per cent higher at 7.31p. Earnings
benefited from a lower tax charge to advance 21 per cent to 21.07p.
Warner Howard, which boasts 75 per cent of the UK market for rented laundry
equipment, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 5.91m to Pounds 6.84m in
the year to February 28, on sales Pounds 1m lower at Pounds 22.2m. Operating
profits of Pounds 6.77m (Pounds 5.92m) included profits of Pounds 112,000
(Pounds 337,000 losses) from discontinued activities.
The drop in turnover reflected the absence of a Pounds 1m contract in 1993
to sell laundry equipment to hotels in the former Soviet Union. Mr Hazell
said the profits on that contract had been so slim that the absence of the
business had not affected profits.
The rentals division, which supplies laundry, hygiene and catering
equipment, remained 'the engine of growth', with sales 7 per cent ahead at
Pounds 13.5m giving operating profits of Pounds 6.7m, a rise of 12 per cent.
The lower margin equipment sales division suffered a Pounds 1.2m drop in
turnover to Pounds 5m and operating profits halved from Pounds 400,000 to
Pounds 200,000.
The service division showed a 19 per cent drop in sales to Pounds 3.7m, with
profits falling from Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 700,000.
Mr Hazell said the group was seeking to be more active on the acquisition
front, in particular to build its hygiene and catering equipment divisions.
Warner Howard had already completed its first purchase this year, paying
Pounds 1.02m for a hygiene rental portfolio.
The purchases would almost certainly be funded through either cash flow or
by gearing up the balance sheet. Warner Howard has net cash of Pounds
600,000.

FT  18 SEP 93 / Gardening: Clear colours and new varieties for autumn -
Pokers are no longer overheated and crocosmias are getting more and more
unusual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN POURING rain this week, gardeners have been able to shelter and enjoy
their Great Autumn Show. I am not sure which is more welcome. The rains have
brought fresh colour to my fuchsias and lengthened the season of the late
sweet peas. The two-day show is held yearly in London's Royal Horticultural
Society halls and continues to raise my sights for autumn. The days seem far
behind us when gardeners complained of too much strong yellow and believed
that dahlias were all vulgar.
In a Great Autumn Show you no longer see chrysanthemums: they now have to
wait until late October. Instead, you confront clear colours in new
varieties from old and new families. Some of them have emerged in families
which used to be all orange and hectic, crocosmias, perhaps, or over-heated
Pokers.
Nowadays, the main Poker at the shows is the pale yellow Little Maid, a
marked reversal of colour and gender. Other pale colours have turned up in
half-hardy families, spread around for the new plantfinding market: I
continue to profit from Brian Hiley's unusual forms of half-hardy salvias
for pots.
Some particularly rewarding forms are coming back from the wild, not least
from Roy Lancaster's recent collections in China. From Paradise Centre in
Suffolk, I admired a tall white-flowered Artemisia called Ghizou but its
exhibitors do not yet list saleable plants of this border-flower for the
future, dark-stemmed and holding its flowers at pleasantly wide intervals to
a height of 4ft or 5ft.
I also admired a new bright apricot Lychnis called cognata. There seem to be
no problems here. Carol Klein, of Glebe Cottage Nurseries, raised it from
seed collected in China and rightly placed it in the foreground of her
outstanding exhibit. She foresees no difficulty with it and so I have bought
one. Lychnis cognata grows about 1 1/2 ft high and has rounded flowers like
an enlarged form of haageana, whose colour is a sensational shade of
apricot. If it continues to flower in autumn, it will soon be all over the
garden centres: whatever will China be found to be hosting next?
Wherever you look nowadays on the smaller stands of hardy plants, good
exhibitors are showing unusual crocosmias, those easy-growing corms with
rushy leaves and flowers which used to be in various shades of orange. Once
upon a time, the red and orange forms were believed to be tender but they
are proven survivors in the worst winters of discontent.
Will the new pale yellows and apricots prove to be so tough when we have a
really testing season? I have been trying to pick the better forms, helped
by John Metcalf, of Four Seasons Nurseries, at Forncett, St Mary, Norwich,
Norfolk NR16 1JT, who supplies by mail order only. Like his exhibit, he has
a sharp sense of the best performers and best value.
Many of us have been struggling with Crocosmia Emily McKenzie, which has
orange flowers with a brown blotch but never seems to last for very long. I
have been blaming my cultivation. Metcalf agrees, and although he sells this
variety, he does not reckon much to it. He prefers the new Star of the East,
which he does not yet stock but which I value for its star-shaped flowers in
orange and its long season at a height of about 2ft. Among the paler
yellows, any visitor to the show would choose Citronella, which is also one
of the cheaper varieties: I have bought one to celebrate and can imagine it
in a sunny bed among the blues of autumn. I also fancy the pale apricot
Solfatare, which has pleasantly bronzed leaves but which does not always
flower freely.
Nobody is entirely certain that these pale-flowered forms will survive a
hard frost but there is one helpful trick: try to feed them with a potash
fertiliser from July onwards so that they build up stronger corms below
ground before the frost.
Other varieties keep turning up, including a newish bright yellow called
George Davison, which looks too orange to my eye, and the older James Cooey,
which has small flowers and has not made much of an impact with me in the
past five years. I would put Citronella first, at least until the winter
sorts it out.
On acid soil, anyone would be seduced by copying the exhibit from Edrom
Nurseries, in Scotland, and multiplying the many forms of autumn gentian as
an edging to their borders. The pale blues and the best white form are quite
appealing but the best are surely the deep blues, which we all associate
with this superb plant for cool northern gardens. I wish that everyone would
plant it instead of yet more heather: once again, the best form seemed to me
to be one of the cheapest, the dark blue macaulayi.
Patient gardeners might consider giving it the background blue of a new
shrub with blue-coloured leaves. Fothergilla Blue Mist was being shown by
Starborough Nurseries below some good specimens of Nyssa sylvatica, which
colours so prettily to red and orange in its leaves. Both these plants grow
slowly and need patience, moisture and no lime. Nonetheless, they ought to
be taken up by gardeners with the right soil and the need to find something
for autumn among a core of azaleas.
As always, I fell for Aylett's marvellous dahlias, the reputation of those
who think that there is nothing between the awful forms with mauve pompons
and the over-estimated red Bishop of Llandaff. A few, well-chosen forms add
backbone and soft colour to a border from August onwards: if you disbelieve
me, you can see them at their best in the National Trust's flowerbeds at
Hidcote before you walk forwards up the famous Red Border.
This year, the pink form with flowers like waterlilies, called Emily
Crutchfield, look irresistible. Alternatively, there is even a pink called
Gay Princess, about the only novelty which the tabloids have still not
sprung on us.
Thirty years ago, I remember the old Great Autumn idiom: apples on plates
against green hessian; musty heleniums and chrysanthemums already on the
in-curve. Nowadays, the best Michaelmas Daisies are small-flowered with
names like Coombe Fishacre, a pale pink, and Little Carlow, a tall
violet-blue at up to 6ft. Neither suffers from the dreaded mildew, which
upsets the older show varieties, especially those with red flowers.
Conscious of the changing fashion, I found myself circling past the tweed
skirts and back to Glebe Cottage's enterprising stand. Even the familiar
Japanese Anemone has taken a new turn in their observant care. They have
picked out a rich rose-pink called Eugenie: she is a richer pink and has an
unusually pretty shape to the flower, which sets her apart from the other
pink forms of the well-known japonica.
She shares their willingness to flourish in dry shade. She is the sort of
speciality which you only see at a seasonal show and so I blessed the RHS's
new willingness to allow plants to be bought throughout show hours and left
with Eugenie in a polythene bag with the RHS symbol. Thirty years ago, not
only the plants were more limited: shopping was strictly curtailed, to the
visitors' disadvantage.

<LEADPARA>  IF GARDENS boast an invisible charm, it must be their pleasing scents.
Visitors walking down the garden paths instinctively stoop to sniff a
glamorous bloom, then exclaim enthusiastically about its fragrance or express
disappointment that it has none.;    That's the way it is with garden
fragrance. It can be subtle, even absent at times, and overwhelming on other
occasions. It all depends on what is in bloom, the time of day or the weather.
A hot day or night can bring out fragrance more strongly, while cool weather
tends to de-emphasize it.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  WITH THE RIGHT PLANNING, YOU CAN ENJOY A
FRAGRANT GARDEN THROUGH MUCH OF YEAR  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Flowers  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     While it is natural to expect a fine bloom to have a fine scent, this is
not always the case. Not all lily varieties or many of the spectacular peonies
or roses are scented.;    However, for those willing to patiently seek out
plants noted for their aromatic virtues, it is possible to fit fragrance into
any seasonal display. Such plants abound among the spring and summer bulbous
species as well as among shrubs, perennials and annuals.;    To enjoy a fully
fragrant garden throughout the growing season, it must be planned and planted
with that purpose in mind. This means selecting varieties that will contribute
their measure of fragrance at different times, from spring until frost.;
Perhaps the most pervasive fragrance is released by many of the hardy lilies
now dominating many gardens with their blooms. Just a single clump of Auraum
hybrids or Regals will permeate an entire garden with heavenly perfume on a
summer evening.;    Other summer bulbous flowers such as Ismenes, tuberoses,
lycoris and Madonna lilies are delightfully fragrant, as are certain daffodils
and hyacinths in spring. Check varieties carefully if scent is your goal; not
all have it.;    Because of their long season of recurring blooms, roses
chosen especially for their spicy fragrance are often the dominant plant in
the scented garden. Some smell like fresh tea leaves; others have a musky
perfume or emit an apple scent. As with bulbous flowers, some roses have no
fragrance.;    Some of the newer introductions and older varieties that are
noteworthy for their fragrance include Double Delight, Amber Queen, Sweet
Surrender, Tropicana, Fragrant Cloud, Sheer Bliss, Intrigue, Oklahoma and the
Rugosa species of roses.;    Many deciduous flowering shrubs can be relied on
to fill the air with pleasing scents at different times. These include lilacs,
honeysuckle, mock orange, some magnolias and most of the viburnums.;
Perennials offer a diverse choice of plant forms and colors whose flowers are
distinguished by their scents, as are the summer phlox at this time. Earlier,
most herbaceous peonies and hostas (but not all) do their part. Others are
lily of the valley, monarda or bee balm, and carnations.;    Certain annuals,
such as sweet alyssum, heliotrope, candytuft, nicotiana, sweet pea, stock and
even petunias, have more elusive scents but can make an impression when grown
massed in beds, which is the best way to grow them anyway.;    It should be
noted that pleasing garden scents are not always, or exclusively, associated
with flowers. A planting of herbs can add exotic scents, although some, like
basil, sage and lavender must be pinched, bruised or cut before they give off
a scent. Even the stately pines and other evergreens will contribute a measure
of fragrance at times to enhance the garden scene.;    For those seriously
contemplating a garden with emphasis on fragrance, Stephen Lacey's new book,
"Scents in Your Garden," (Little, Brown, $40) is a timely publication.
Lavishly illustrated, it digs deep into the roots of the idea, with sound
suggestions on how to attain what he calls the "most potent and bewitching
substance in the gardener's repertory."  </TEXT>

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A Houston couple who decided to
celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary with their first foreign
vacation haven't gotten the romantic island getaway they planned.
   ``I feel like I've been a hostage here,'' grumbled Melvin Hazel
on Monday.
   ``We're eating a good meal and no one's pointing any guns at
me,'' said his wife, Darlene, confiding: ``I have a lot of sense of
adventure.''
   They're among some two dozen Americans still stranded on this
Caribbean island where Moslem extremists stormed Parliament and the
state television building on Friday, seizing the prime minister and
other officials.
   Some of the Americans have since left the island on one of a few
packed flights by regional carriers. But most have been unable to
leave.
   ``Doesn't the American government have any responsibility for
us? They've shown no intention of helping us,'' said Nancy Schnair,
here with husband Howard Schnair of Chicago on a planned combined
business-vacation trip.
   Lucy Hall, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, said American visitors to
the island were being contacted and assured their government was
concerned about them.
   ``We can't help them because we don't run any airlines,'' Ms.
Hall said of American requests for help getting off Trinidad. She
said some 2,100 U.S. citizens, the great majority of them
residents, are on the islands.
   ``I just want to be somewhere else,'' said Chris Bigalkie, here
on business as regional vice president of Drew Industrial Division.
``We don't have anything like this in Memphis (Tenn., his
hometown).''
   The Schnairs, another couple on a combined business-pleasure
trip _ Martin and Joyce Beckwith of Boston _ and the Hazels of
Houston spent much of Monday morning sitting on the airy veranda of
the Hilton Hotel overlooking this capital city.
   They heard the volleys of gunfire and explosions and saw fire
erupt from the state television complex, where rebels were holding
hostages.
   Hazel, who works in construction, said he and his wife, with
three children in their 20s, wanted to celebrate their 30th
anniversary in style. They had once met some Trinidadians who sang
the praises of their island, and they thought this would be the
perfect place for a long-delayed second honeymoon.
   They arrived Thursday and spent Friday sightseeing. But when
their taxi driver returned Friday evening to take them to dinner at
a seafood restaurant as they requested, he advised them not to go
downtown because of the violence.
   They scrubbed plans to visit sister island Tobago, and now are
only anxious to go home.
   ``They really messed it up for us,'' said Mrs. Hazel.

FT  16 DEC 93 / Arts: Ayckbourn's Wildest Dreams - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the themes of Alan Ayckbourn's comedies is power: the power that some
people have over others, within a tight little nexus of neighbourhood
relationships. The power may be wielded generously and without malice - even
unconsciously; but upon those who fall under its influence its effect is
terrible. In Wildest Dreams (1991), now reaching London for the first time,
it is the newcomer Marcie who at once exerts her sympathetic and inquisitive
influence upon a group of four people. Manically ingratiating, tremendously
keen, and wholly fixated on whoever she is talking to, she has, within days,
changed all four lives - irrevocably.
These four are Stanley and Hazel Inchbridge (childless, in their early
middle age, sharing a house with Hazel's mini-Hitler brother Austen), Warren
(a lonely teenage boffin, convinced that he is a humanoid alien) and Rick
(an introvert in her early 20s, abused in the past by her mother's lover and
then left by both him and her mother). What links them is their weekly
meetings to play The Game.
This board game involves them in role-playing in a sub-Tolkien fantasy which
unites the four of them against the world (but into which Marcie enters
wholeheartedly for a while). This shared fantasy is one of Ayckbourn's most
wonderful comic constructions: ludicrous but dreadfully credible. And Marcie
herself is another of his master-strokes. She really is an alien; and we
never understand her.
But her four friends we quickly understand only too well; and some of
Ayckbourn's finest writing goes into entering their unhappy private worlds.
His most novel and least comic conception is Rick: butch and vulnerable,
probably lesbian but powerfully susceptible to male dominance. Her first
encounter with Marcie's husband is an extraordinary scene, in which he all
too easily slips into the role of the abusive patriarch who bullies and
molests her. Rick, like Stanley and Warren, falls in love with Marcie. Yet,
even though she comes far closer to Marcie than the men, she too is taken
over by her.
Everything else Ayckbourn visits with his characteristic blend of
psychological penetration and sociological satire. Hazel (who during the
play suffers the breakdown that so many of this playwright's married women
do) has a marvellous attack of depression early in the play: 'I sometimes
catch myself staring at myself in that bathroom mirror and I think - what
have you done with that body, Hazel? . . . Look at it. Shrivelling and
drooping and wasting away - covered in brown spots and warts and wrinkles
and what use have you ever made of it? Nothing . . .'
There are passages, especially in the later stages of the tale of Hazel and
Stanley, that feel too close to Ayckbourn formula; and the ending, though it
has poetic justice, lacks the dramatic tension that rules the first
three-quarters of the play. But, though there are umpteen ingredients
identifiable from other Ayckbourn, most of them do not feel familiar as you
watch.
Two features of this London staging have particular importance. One is that
this is the first time the RSC has performed an Ayckbourn play. The other is
that the play is being performed in The Pit, the auditorium that (among
London's theatres) most closely resembles the Stephen Joseph
Theatre-in-the-Round in Scarborough, for which Ayckbourn creates his plays.
All the cast do excellent work. Brenda Blethyn (Hazel), Barry McCarthy
(Stanley) and Peter Laird (Austen) create in detail the awful truths of the
Inchbridges' home. Gary Whitaker slightly forces Warren's boyish
unworldliness. As Rick, Jenna Russell is outstanding, playing this
untheatrical and subdued character with utter objectivity.
Playing the vivid humanoid Marcie, Sophie Thompson excels herself. She has
here an appalling nervous energy, and a whole musical inventory of nervous
laughs: scales and arpeggios upward or downward, mini-trills, and staccati
on one note. It is this nervousness which makes Marcie so alarmingly real.
How can someone so unrelaxed invade other people's lives and overwhelm them?
Yet she can, and does. 'And,' as Clement Crisp would say, 'we believe.'
At the Pit, 071-638-8891, until March 12; then transferring to the Swan
Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.

FT  02 JAN 93 / Gardening: Coping with that seven-year itch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YEAR is a gardener's time for plans, reflections and memories. My plans
are obvious: do better; kill more weeds; spray earlier against black spot
and replant that supreme luxury, a wide, newly-manured border, emptied of
its previous jungle and creeping buttercups.
It looks as though single white Japanese anemones will have a large part to
play. They have been one of my plants of 1992, refuting the notion that they
prefer a dry year in dry soil. They will grow almost anywhere, but sometimes
they need a few years to establish themselves. During the 1990s, they will
have their chance to spread beneath a background of holly and a light canopy
of sycamores on the problematic fringes of my garden.
As for reflections, mine run in a particular direction. I keep thinking of
the principle which we all cite, but never fully obey: whenever you start a
new garden or a new design, plant the permanencies and big features first.
Time races by, until the seven-year wait for the first flowers on a Winter
Sweet or the white buds on a Magnolia Grandiflora seem like a tiny
interruption in the long road of a gardener's lifetime.
But whatever your time of life, the principle still applies. Think long term
and do not make the inevitable mistake of being half-hearted. I never
succeed in thinking out the long-lasting framework for an entire garden as a
first move and I am always diverted in places by an anxious wish for
immediate colour.
Although seven years seem an eternity when we first set out, ignore the
prospect and always choose the best for the future, a Magnolia Wilsonii, not
a Ribes, a hedge of clipped box rather than laurel. Always begin by planting
as many of the trees, large shrubs and hedges as you can.
As for the memories, they are less grandiose - 1992 turned out to be a
remarkable year. The spring was very dry and early and, by mid-June, it
seemed that everything in the garden would be over at once. After a mad
acceleration of the season, it began to rain, gaining momentum in July and
starting a welcome overture which has led up to the recent torrential
winter, unparalleled in my memory. At the same time, the air remained
unusually mild, giving us a vintage year for winter jasmine, magnolias and
winter-flowering cherry, until these recent frosts.
If I could plant only one tree for the longer term, it would still be a
winter cherry, of which the best form is the best-known, Prunus Subhirtella
Autumnalis. Between the early drought and the later floods, evergreens and
trees grew heroically. In the recent dry summers, survivors have been
putting down deep roots: this year, they confirmed the old wisdom, that
plants puzzle beginners by growing downwards for the first two or three
years and then race upwards thereafter. Never single out a shrub as a slow
performer on the sole evidence of early height.
In 1992, young yews, box and the admirable evergreen Osmanthus started to
grow rapidly upwards, after four years of sending deep roots down for water.
As a postscript, berries then appeared by the thousand on all sorts of
trees, making one of the best autumns for fruiting in my memory.
Since September, it has been the year of the Sorbus and I doubt if the Far
Eastern forms have ever been finer in Britain. Readers with Plantfinders
might share my enthusiasm for Adenophora Tashiroi, which comes from Japan
and covers itself in pale grey-blue flowers like small lampshades. It is
only a foot-high when in flower and, despite the books, appears to be
completely happy in full sun and a stony soil.
Beside it, I had a group of the various Parahebes in white and pale
milk-blue flowers. Again, these small evergreen shrubs make marvellous
edging for any low border and seem to flower throughout the summer. The
frost has not hurt them and I cannot imagine why gardeners grow them so
seldom.
Before the black spot, roses had an admirable fling in that extraordinary
June where everything was running at least two weeks early. I have started
to notice the qualities of some of the more delicate roses which were bred
in the early 1950s and are now beginning to seem old-fashioned: I strongly
recommend a quiet evening's research in Peter Beales' admirable reference
book Classic Roses, in which he does proper justice to forgotten roses, bred
in this era and kept in the trade by his nursery list, and often by no
other.
Elsewhere, many climbers were magnificent, although they flowered absurdly
early. For the first time, maturity showed me the full loveliness of
climbing Madame Paul Lede. It flowers only once, but the huge double heads
are a unique shade of dusky apricot pink, like the silk of a fine Edwardian
dress.
My most lasting memory is not a rose nor, indeed, a flower of any kind:
rather, 1992 was the Year of the Slug. In the wet weather, these non-human
companions became fat, bloated and abominably slimy. They played hell with
the hostas, but I am also pleased to be armed with an excellent modern
antidote. Called Growing Success, it is pet-friendly, plant-friendly and
slug-hostile. Slugs, I suppose, cannot help it, but they do have atrocious
appetites: Growing Success removes them by the dozen, efficiently, cleanly
and as victors can always afford to be magnanimous, I hope that the dozens
who died in 1992 died, in their non-linguistic world, without any real pain.

FT  25 JAN 92 / Gardening: . . . and Charity went to seed - The results of a
chance encounter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST spectacular shrub in my garden for some weeks has been Mahonia
Charity, a fine evergreen with long leaves composed of a number of
holly-like leaflets and small yellow flowers in slender spikes, themselves
arranged in large, cartwheel-shaped clusters.
It was a chance hybrid between two wild species named M. lomariifolia and M.
japonica which was picked out of a nursery bed early in the 1950s by Sir
Eric Savill, who was buying plants for the Savill Garden in Windsor Great
Park. When he discovered that, among his plants, he had an entirely new
variety, he thought he had been very fortunate; and so he named his find
Charity.
Since then, a number of seedlings from Charity have been raised in the
Savill Garden and two have been named and distributed. One is called Faith
and the other Hope and both can be obtained from the Savill nursery.
Something like 200 seedlings were raised by the late Lionel Fortescue at the
Garden House, Buckland Monochorum, Devon, by making deliberate crosses
between M. lomariifolia and M. japonica. The idea was partly to test the
theory that this really was the parentage of Charity and partly to find out
if he could produce something different and possibly better.
The theory was proved correct and some seedlings of great merit were
obtained, a few of which were named and two of which, Buckland and Lionel
Fortescue, are available fairly readily.
Finally, the Slieve Donard Nursery in Northern Ireland, the area where the
accidental cross occurred (although this was not the nursery from which Sir
Eric Savill got his plant) also made the cross by hand and gave the name
Winter Sun to what it considered the best seedling. This, too, is available
from a number of shrub nurseries.
Unlike M. japonica, which spreads and sprawls, Charity and its man-made
cousins all grow rather stiffly erect and get to look a little gaunt with
age. But they respond well to pruning in spring and this can be done to keep
them shorter and make them bushier. My own plant has been shortened once and
is now about 9 ft high with many fine flower clusters.
As usual, the first rhododendron to flower in my garden this year was R.
nobleanum. (This is also a hybrid between R. arboreum and R. caucasicum) but
one that has been made deliberately and repeatedly, the first recorded cross
being in 1829. Because of this multiplicity of breeding, with each cross
probably made between parents that were a little different, there are many
variations on the hybrids themselves.
Not that you will find it easy to buy plants of R. nobleanum. Even the Plant
Finder is able to list only nine sources; but one of them is the great
private woodland garden, Leonardslee in Sussex, which has a small nursery.
Inquiries can be sent to Leonardslee Garden, 1 Mill Lane, Lower Beeding,
West Sussex.
Rhododendrun nobleanum has small clusters of funnel-shaped, rose-pink
flowers which pale to white at the throat. For display, it cannot stand
comparison with the splendid Hardy Hybrids that flower in May and early
June, but it is a cheering sight on a winter's day when there is nothing
remotely like it in flower.
Viburnum farreri is flowering exceptionally well this winter and I rate it
ahead of its offspring, V. Dawn, because the stems are more slender and
flexible and the flower clusters, although smaller, are more numerous and
make, I think, a prettier display. They are apple-blossom pink, paling to
white with age, and are scented sweetly; but, on this score, I think there
is little to choose between the species and its offspring. The individual
flower clusters of Dawn are, however, at least three times the size of those
of farreri and they start off a strong rose-pink, paling to near-white with
age.
The full story of Viburnum bodnantense Dawn (to give this fine shrub its
full name) makes piquant reading. It is a hybrid between V. farreri and the
more tender but larger-flowered V. grandiflorum, and the cross was made
first in 1933 in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh, by Charles Lamont the
assistant curator. But he did not think any of his seedlings represented any
improvement on either of the parents so he did not even bother to give any
of them a name, let alone distribute them.
About 1935, the same cross was made in Lord Aberconwy's garden at Bodnant,
in the Conwy River valley in north Wales, with a totally different result.
The best seedling was exhibited at a Royal Horticultural Society show in
London, received an award of merit and was named Dawn. Years later,
Nottcutt's Nursery, which now has its headquarters at Woodbridge in Suffolk,
made a similar cross, called its best seedling Deben and got an even higher
award from the RHS - a first-class certificate.
The Edinburgh Botanic Gardens had not abandoned its plants, though, and
called one of its seedlings Charles Lamont. Whether it has ever been put up
for an award, I do not know, but there are good gardeners who consider it
the best of the lot.
The happy ending to this story is that although Dawn and Deben are by far
the easiest to buy, plants of Charles Lamont are available from at least a
dozen nurseries. Consult the Plant Finder for addresses.

be recycled into outdoor garden plants. There are actually four or five rooted
cuttings planted together in one pot. After the plant finishes blooming, snip
off the dead flowers. Leave the stems about 6 to 8 inches long. Remove the
plant from the pot and separate the individual plants. Plant these individual

   Darkie toothpaste is being renamed and redesigned
to remove its logo of a grinning black minstrel after several groups
complained to Colgate-Palmolive Co. that the product was offensive,
the company said Friday.
   The toothpaste is manufactured and sold in Asia by the Hong
Kong-based Hawley &amp; Hazel Group. Colgate-Palmolive, which sells
household and hygiene products worldwide, became a joint partner
with Hawley &amp; Hazel in 1985.
   Since then, a group of congressmen and the Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, a coalition of church investors, have been
putting pressure on the companies to change what they said is
racially offensive packaging.
   The popular product, which has remained unchanged for 62 years,
will be renamed Darlie in all of its markets _ Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand _ within a year, Colgate-Palmolive
said.
   The company said the logo will be changed to a ``to a
non-racially offensive silhouette'' _ a racially ambiguous man in a
top hat.
   ``The management of Hawley &amp; Hazel and Colgate-Palmolive have
agreed that the old name and package presentation represents
offensive racial stereotyping that should be changed,''
Colgate-Palmolive said in a statement.
   ``We think it's acceptable,'' said Dara Demmings, a spokesman for
the Interfaith Coalition, which seeks to influence social and
financial issues within corporations through stock ownership.
   In addition to pressure from the coalition, three Interfaith
members who each owned at least $1,000 worth of Colgate stock
registered objections at a shareholders meeting in May.
   The shareholders included the Illinois-based School Sisters of
St. Francis; Southern Province of the Missionary Oblates of Mary
Immaculate in San Antonio, Texas, and a nun who owns shares for the
Sisters of Loretta, based in Kentucky.
   Similar pressure from outside groups led Quaker Oats Co. to
modify its Aunt Jemima figure in the 1960s to make her look less
like a plantation cook and forced the Sambo's restaurant chain to
rename itself No Place Like Sam's in the 1970s.
   Ms. Demmings said she believed Colgate-Palmolive officials were
hampered by objections from Hawley &amp; Hazel, who told a group of
congressmen as late as last month that it had no plans to change the
product's name.
   ``It's unfortunate that it took so long,'' said New York Rep.
Edolpus Towns, a member of the Congressional Government Operations
Committee who voiced objections to the product during a visit to
Taiwan in December.
   Towns also praised Colgate-Palmolive for making ``a diligent
effort since day one of their relationship (with Hawley) to correct
this insensitive name and logotype.''
   Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, another committee member,
praised the company ``for its understanding, albeit late,'' and
urged other companies to ``act accordingly.''
