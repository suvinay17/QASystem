<TEXT>
   The executive producer of ABC's ``20-20''
acknowledged Saturday that the television show was duped by an
impostor claiming to be Buckwheat from the classic ``Our Gang''
comedies.
   William ``Billy'' Thomas, the actor who played Buckwheat, died
nearly a decade ago.
   On ``20-20'' Friday night, Hugh Downs narrated a segment in
which the series claimed to have found Buckwheat working as a
grocery bagger in Tempe, Ariz. The impostor, Bill English, said he
had changed his last name from Thomas and refused to sign
autographs because it would interfere with his work.
   ``20-20'' spokeswoman Maurie Perl said Saturday that Thomas'
obituaries proved English was a fake and the show would apologize
during its next broadcast Friday.
   ``(Executive producer Victor Neufeld) feels indeed there was a
lapse in the research done by the production team and we may very
well have made a mistake,'' Ms. Perl said. ``Obviously we are upset
and dismayed with the mistake.''
   Thomas' friends and family said they were angry the impostor
received a national television audience.
   Thomas died Oct. 10, 1980, of a heart attack at age 49, said his
son, William Thomas Jr. of Covina, Calif.
   The elder Thomas appeared in 89 ``Our Gang'' films, starting in
1934 - when he was 3 years old - until the series ended in 1944.
   ``I just can't believe `20-20' didn't investigate this better.
I'm somewhat dumbfounded by the whole thing,'' Bill Thomas said
Saturday.
   ``We did not mean to cause any pain or unpleasantness for any of
Buckwheat's family or friends,'' Ms. Perl said. ``With regard to
the production team, obviously they will be reprimanded and that
will be handled internally.'' Thomas, who runs Buckwheat
Enterprises and makes a living licensing the character, said
impostors threaten his business. He has filed several lawsuits to
protect the name.
   George McFarland, 62, the child star who played Buckwheat's
sidekick Spanky, said he spoke Saturday with Neufeld and the
producer ``was terribly concerned about what had happened.''
McFarland, who lives in Fort Worth, said he too has been dogged by
impostors.
   Richard W. Bann, who co-wrote the 1976 book ``Our Gang, the Life
and Times of the Little Rascals,'' with Leonard Maltin, said the
error hurt the ABC news magazine show's credibility.
   ``What kind of research is this? You would think that at this
level of investigative reporting, you would catch something like
this,'' he said from his Los Angeles home. ``It sort of undermines
anything you'll ever see on that show again. And next week, they'll
find Elvis.''
   A Tempe viewer suggested the profile, said Ms. Perl.
   ``I don't believe in the 12 years of the broadcast we have ever
had such a problem and we will without question tighten all
research and review processes,'' she said.
   The ``Our Gang'' series, which included 221 short films and one
of feature length, began in 1922 with the dual billing: ``Hal Roach
presents his Rascals in their latest Our Gang comedy titled ...''
   The term ``Little'' was added to ``Rascals'' when the films were
broadcast on television beginning in 1955.
   The series starred several child actors, including Robert Blake
and Jackie Cooper. The kids had a pit bull named ``Pete the Pup''
with a circle painted around one eye.
   A year to the day after Thomas died, Eddie Murphy began his
parody of an adult Buckwheat on NBC's ``Saturday Night.''

   A man who appeared on ABC's ``20-20'' claiming he
played Buckwheat in the classic ``Our Gang'' comedies was an
impostor, the actor who played Spanky said.
   The child actor who portrayed Buckwheat died nearly a decade ago
at age 49, George ``Spanky'' McFarland said.
   A ``20-20'' news magazine segment narrarated by Hugh Downs
reported Friday that an elderly man who portrayed Buckwheat in the
Hal Roach film comedies was found working as a grocery bagger in
Tempe, Ariz.
   The man, who identified himself as Bill English, said he had
changed his name from Bill Thomas.
   The real Buckwheat, whose name was William ``Billy'' Thomas,
died nearly 10 years ago, McFarland said.
   ``I don't have the slightest idea who he was, but he wasn't
Buckwheat,'' said McFarland, 62, who watched the ``20-20'' program.
   McFarland said from his Fort Worth home that he last saw the
real Buckwheat at an ``Our Gang'' reunion in Los Angeles in 1980,
shortly before Thomas died of a heart attack.
   Richard W. Bann, who co-wrote a 1976 book on the ``Our Gang''
stars, also said the real Buckwheat is dead.
   ``Buckwheat ain't giving no more interviews,'' said Bann, who
watched the show in Los Angeles.
   ``20-20'' spokeswoman Maurie Perl said the show thought it had
the right Buckwheat. ``We did our research, and to the best of our
knowledge, we're not aware that he passed away,'' she said.
   The man claiming to be Buckwheat could not immediately be
reached for comment. There was only one William English listed in
the Tempe-area phone directories, and a person who answered that
number said it wasn't the same one.
   According to the book ``Our Gang, the Life and Times of the
Little Rascals,'' by Bann and film critic Leonard Maltin, William
``Billy'' Thomas appeared in 89 ``Our Gang'' films from 1934 until
the series ended in 1944.
   The ``Our Gang'' series, which included 221 short films and one
of feature length, began in 1922 with the billing: ``Hal Roach
presents his Rascals in their latest Our Gang comedy titled ...''
   The term ``Little'' was added to ``Rascals'' when the films were
broadcast on television beginning in 1955.
   A number of well-known actors starred in the shows over the
years, including Robert Blake and Jackie Cooper.

Lynn Murray, the producer responsible for an interview with what has proven to 
be a bogus Buckwheat on last Friday's installment of "20/20," resigned in a 
"mutual decision" with the network, an ABC News spokeswoman confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Neufeld, the program's executive producer, decided that Murray did not 
properly handle the research of a segment entitled "Whatever Happened to 'Our 
Gang'? " and that it would be best if she resigned, said Maurie Perl, the 
show's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Murray had worked on the program in a variety of jobs for the past 10 years, 
Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, "20/20" claimed to have found the actor who played Buckwheat in 
the "Our Gang" comedies of the 1930s and '40s working as a grocery bagger in 
Tempe, Ariz. He was interviewed on the air. 
</P>
<P>
William Thomas, the man who actually portrayed Buckwheat, died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Downs will apologize on the air in tonight's broadcast of the 12-year-old 
news magazine "for any pain and discomfort" the mistake might have caused 
Thomas' family, Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
After last week's show, Thomas' son, Bill Thomas Jr., and George McFarland, who 
played Spanky in the "Our Gang" comedies (later retitled "The Little Rascals" 
for television), criticized the "20/20" report, and ABC subsequently 
acknowledged having been duped. 
</P>
<P>
The imposter, Bill English, told ABC that he changed his last name and refused 
to sign autographs because it would interfere with his work at the supermarket. 
Perl said that the idea to interview English came in a letter from a viewer, 
not from English himself. English apparently has been telling people he is 
Buckwheat for the past 30 years, Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
Several observers, including Richard W. Bann, who with Leonard Maltin wrote the 
1976 book, "Our Gang: The Life and Times of the Little Rascals," maintained 
that the mistake undermines "20/20's" credibility. "Next week, they'll find 
Elvis," Bann quipped to the Associated Press.

   A producer responsible for an interview with
a Buckwheat impostor on ABC's ``20-20'' has resigned, the network
says.
   Lynn Murray resigned in a ``mutual decision'' with ABC after
last week's segment ``Whatever Happened to `Our Gang?''' said
``20-20'' spokeswoman Maurie Perl.
   The news magazine aired an interview with a man who claimed he

and was now working as a grocery bagger in Tempe, Ariz.
   William Thomas, who actually portrayed Buckwheat, died in 1980.

for 10 years, Perl said.

   Thomas' son, William Thomas Jr., and George McFarland, who
played Spanky in the ``Our Gang'' comedies, challenged last week's
broadcast. ABC later acknowledged the bogus Buckwheat, Bill
English, had pulled a hoax.
   English had told ``20-20'' during the interview that he had
changed his name so he could work at the supermarket without being
recognized.
   Perl said the interview was suggested by a viewer and that
English apparently has told people for the past 30 years that he
played Buckwheat.
   The ``Our Gang'' episodes were renamed ``The Little Rascals''
for television.

<TEXT>     Although Spanky grew up and became an adult named George McFarland, the kid
inside the man has managed to get out in recent years and re-establish
himself.;    "I started to bring Spanky back about six years ago," said George
McFarland, 62, who was in Memphis for the North American Film Festival.;   
"Spanky had never really been away," said McFarland, who is still short and
stocky and resembles the character he played 50 years ago. "But it was only
recently that I started actively making money on the name.";    For years,
McFarland had allowed Spanky to fade into obscurity while he tried to
establish himself as a breadwinner by working at various nondescript jobs,
including laborer, chauffeur and hamburger cook.;    Twice, after his
childhood acting career had ended, McFarland tried to find work in Hollywood.
"I didn't want to be a star or even have supporting parts," he said, "I wanted
to work as an extra. I was tired of pumping gas, frying hamburgers and trying
to sell insurance. I really didn't know how to do anything but act. But I
couldn't get myself re-established and so I finally told 'em to stick it -- I
don't need you.";    Although McFarland eventually succeeded as a salesman --
he's retired now -- he was never quite able to put Spanky behind him.;    "I
make personal appearances in video stores and sign autographs and talk about
the 'Our Gang' comedies," he said. "And occasionally I come to one of these
film festivals, where fans are interested in movies that were made in the '30s
and '40s.";    McFarland, a grandfather, has no regrets.;    "I had a good
life. I wouldn't take a nickel for the experience of being Spanky, and I
wouldn't give you a nickel to do it again. I made 95 of those short films. I
started at $50 a week and when it was over 13 years later, I was making $1,350
a week. Within a year, I was broke. But it turned out all right, and I'm happy
about it." (box)  </TEXT>

   When five people were indicted on charges
of sexually abusing children at a day-care center, the news
reverberated through this town of 5,800, seemingly touching
everyone.
   In the months since the first allegations were made against
Little Rascals' Day Care Center last January, wave after wave of
indictments have been handed up. Court documents listing 202
charges say day-care workers had intercourse in front of children
and performed oral and anal sex with them from September 1988 to
January 1989.
   The initial reports were based on evidence from 21 children who
were allegedly molested, but prosecutors say all of the
approximately 70 children who attended the center are potential
witnesses. The center lost its license in June and was closed.
   Nearly everyone here knows someone who has been indicted or the
family of a child involved in the case.
   ``I've watched some of the parents of victims grow up,'' said
Alton Elmore, owner of Edenton Furniture and a Chowan County
commissioner. ``And I've watched some of them who've been charged
grow up.''
   That sense of community makes it doubly difficult for residents
to deal with the sudden onslaught of news media and curiosity
seekers.
   A clerk at a children's clothing store shied away from
discussing the case with a stranger. ``The manager of the store's
little girl is involved in it, so I don't think I should say
anything,'' she said.
   Other people offered similar responses.
   ``It's just a bad situation. Some are very upset,'' said John
Smith, owner of Edenton Floral Co., a block away from the choppy
waters of the Albemarle Sound.
   But while people are reluctant to talk about the case to
outsiders, they are freer among themselves. Rumors grew so abundant
at one point that District Attorney H.P. Williams issued a
statement warning residents that they could jeopardize the state's
case.
   Townspeople are beginning to tire of the lengthy pre-trial
hearings, sometimes grumbling that Williams has been dragging his
feet since the first hearing April 14, when the first arrest
occurred.
   Williams, up for re-election next November, has sometimes found
himself in an unkind public spotlight and appeared reluctant to
discuss even tangential issues.
   Public outrage and a concern for the children may have prompted
bonds ranging from $375,000 to $1.5 million _ so high that only one
defendant has been released.
   All but one of the defendants is charged with the same four
crimes: engaging in sex with a child under 13, taking indecent
liberties with a minor, crimes against nature, and conspiracy to
commit indecent liberties with a child.
   The fifth, former Little Rascals' employee Shelley Stone, is
charged with all but crimes against nature.
   All five defendants have pleaded innocent.
   Robert Kelly Jr., 41, who operated Little Rascals with his wife,
Elizabeth Kelly, 34, is in jail on $1.5 million bond. He is charged
with 152 counts involving at least 21 boys and girls under age 13.
   Mrs. Kelly is charged with 19 counts involving eight children
and faces a $1 million bond. A friend of the Kellys', Willard Scott
Privott, 40, has been charged with 13 counts involving six
children, plus kidnapping and terrorizing one girl. He is being
held on $1 million bond.
   Kathryn Dawn Wilson, 23, another employee, is charged with 19
counts involving eight children.
   Ms. Stone, who is accused of nine counts, is the only one of the
five to post bond _ $375,000 in her case. However her lawyer said
he was worried that she might be named in new indictments and
arrested without warning.
   Joe Cheshire, the Raleigh attorney representing Kelly, called it
``an incredible case.'' He contended that much of the children's
testimony would show that nothing wrong had taken place, and would
exonerate his client.
   ``It's very strange to me,'' Cheshire said. ``You have a couple
of kids make some statements and months later you have some more
and now we hear there are some more. I'd just like to find out how
that process happened.''
   But Assistant Attorney General Bill Hart said there is no
mystery about the process.
   ``We have had continuing disclosure just like the defense has
been getting,'' he said. ``Children don't just come running out of
their houses screaming, `I've been molested.'''
   Elmore said each new revelation rocks the community in a way
he's never experienced. ``A lot of good people and the families of
good people have gotten hurt,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   George McFarland, the chubby child star
Spanky of ``Our Gang'' and ``Little Rascals,'' wants about $100,000
from a saloon that he says used his name and face for 13 years
without permission.
   Federal Judge James Rosenbaum on Thursday ordered the saloon not
to use the ``visage or name'' of Spanky. It's not enough for
McFarland.
   In March, seven months after McFarland filed a lawsuit, the
owner of the bar changed its name from Spanky's Saloon to Checker's
Nightclub.
   Drawings of a round-faced kid wearing a beanie came down from
the front of the building and from interior walls. Patrons no
longer could buy jackets, T-shirts and hats imprinted with the
Spanky's Saloon logo.
   Other businesses pay the McFarland, 62, who lives in Fort Worth,
Texas, for the right to use his name and childhood face. McFarland
wants similar retroactive payments from the owner and former
co-owner of the St. Paul bar.
   ``He's after 5 percent of their gross profits for 13 years and
that's an exorbitant amount of money, even if they did something
wrong,'' said Dennis Johnson, a lawyer for the bar's former owner,
Michael Kalis.
   Kalis sold his interest in the bar to his partner, Walter
Engelhardt, in 1982.
   Johnson and Engelhardt, who represented himself in court,
contend that the bar's name had little to do with its business and
that the connection with McFarland was unintentional.
   Marshall Tanick, a Minneapolis attorney representing McFarland,
said they denied his client his legitimate livelihood. He said the
Spanky name and image are McFarland's meal ticket.
   Tanick also accused the bar owners of tarnishing McFarland's
name by associating it with heavy metal bands that perform at the
bar. McFarland was shocked when he discovered his name had been
linked to such bands as ``Raw Meat,'' ``Primal Scream'' and ``Blue
Murder,'' Tanick said in court papers.
   ``Spanky's wholesome appeal, particularly to families and
children, is debased by associating him with these morbid
musicians,'' the lawsuit contended.
   In addition to 13 years of licensing fees and legal costs,
McFarland also wants all the merchandise and bar equipment
featuring the Spanky's logo.
   Rosenbaum urged attorneys to work out an agreement regarding the
merchandise and took McFarland's other claims under advisement.

<HEAD>Scientist Begin Training And Feeding Broad Bay Dolphin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young dolphin that has refused to
leave Broad Bay's chilly waters for six weeks despite two federal
rescue attempts is being trained to survive the winter.
   ``Because he's young, he would normally be in a herd of dolphins
and depend on the experience of older animals for guidance,'' Joseph
R. Geraci, a U.S. Marine Mammal Commission veterinarian, said Sunday.
   ``Without that guidance, his greatest need as I see it is for
social contact. Being in cold water, he also needs a lot of food.''
   Dolphin trainer Richard L. Trout has begun school for the young
animal, nicknamed ``Rascal'' by residents.
   Trout, who has trained the sea mammals for 15 years, raps on the
side of his boat three times to bring Rascal to the surface. When
the dolphin surfaces, Trout tosses him a sea trout or herring.
Rather than gobble the treat, Rascal bounces it on his nose or kicks
it with his tail.
   Trout said that is a natural habit of dolphins who consider dead
fish toys rather than food. He must train Rascal to stop playing
with his food.
   The decision to help Rascal learn to adapt to his new
surroundings ends six weeks of debate over his fate. Residents
became concerned when he stayed in the bay while other dolphins
headed down the Atlantic Coast in the fall.
   Rascal had become a favorite of boaters as he would swim along
side pleasure boats and entertain residents along the shore.
   Federal officials approved two rescue attempts, but both failed.
   Because of the dropping water temperatures _ now in the low 40s _
most of the small fish that dolphins feed on have left the bay, and
Geraci said that Rascal, at about 250 pounds, is lighter than
normally would be expected.
   Federal law prohibits training or feeding of wild dolphins in
open water, but Geraci said Rascal's circumstances made him a
special case.
   ``He's got none of the scars that dolphins get by wrestling and
playing in the herd,'' Geraci said. ``He's in good physical
condition. He's bright-eyed, very alert and responsive.''
   Rascal's apparent health and the fact that the animal has adapted
to cold water in Broad Bay probably means the animal can survive
until warmer weather arrives in six to eight weeks, Geraci said.

<TEXT>
   Colonial-style buildings still line the
business district in this town on Albemarle Sound that once was
North Carolina's colonial capital. The picturesque small town
retains a quaint charm.
   But Edenton also is the site of the state's biggest and most
complicated child-abuse case.
   Prosecutors allege that over the course of a year at the Little
Rascals Day Care Center, 29 children were sexually assaulted by the
owners, employees and a friend of the owner. All seven deny the
charges.
   With more than 400 counts, the case exceeds that of the McMartin
Pre-School trial in California in which the defendants were
acquitted earlier this year. One of those defendants, Raymond
Buckey, was tried a second time, but the prosecution ended with a
deadlocked jury in July and the charges were dropped.
   The McMartin case consumed seven years of court time ad cost
Los Angeles County more than $13.5 million, making it the longest,
most expensive criminal court case in U.S. history.
   Many of Edenton's 5,800 residents are uneasy discussing the case
here. Many have close friends on both sides, and District Attorney
H.P. Williams has asked residents not to spread ``unfounded''
statements about the case.
   ``I'm getting tired of hearing about it,'' said Steve, an
attendant at a service station who wouldn't give his last name. ``I
wish they'd just get going and get it over with. A lot of people
feel that way.''
   The case broke when someone lodged a complaint in January 1989
alleging abuse of children at the center. The state Child Day Care
section in Raleigh revoked the center's license in March 1989 and
one of the center's owners, Bob Kelly, was arrested shortly after.
   Prosecutors allege that children between the ages of 2 and 7
were raped, sodomized and assaulted. The indictments allege that
most of the assaults occurred between September 1988 and January
1989.
   The defendants are Little Rascals co-owners Kelly, 41, and his
wife, Elizabeth Twiddy Kelly, 34; Willard Scott Privott, 40;
Darlene McDonald Harris, 25; and three former employees of the
center - Shelley Alyce Stone, 34; Kathryn Dawn Wilson, 24; and
Robin Boles Byrum, 19. All but two remain in jail in lieu of bond.
   All seven could face multiple life sentences if convicted.
   The case hit a snag in October when the judge handling the case
cited its ``complexities'' and withdrew after the state Supreme
Court overturned his ruling that the defendants should be tried
separately.
   A new judge was selected.
   ``I would say we may not be at square one, but we're certainly
at square two,'' said Joe Cheshire, a lawyer representing Mrs.
Kelly, referring to the new judge.
   The new judge is still looking over the case, Cheshire said
Sunday. ``He is reviewing the file and I assume we are waiting for
a court date at which we will discuss where we stand.'' He said no
decision had been made on whether the defendants would stand trial
together or in small groups.
   Bill Hart, a lawyer from the state attorney general's office
assigned to help prosecute the case, said that the earliest it
could go to trial would be January.
   ``We're hoping (the trial) will only take six to eight weeks,''
Hart said. ``Of course, you never can guarantee about the length of
a trial.''
   Cheshire said that in his opinion, a January trial is``highly
unlikely, seeking as how it's almost Thanksgiving.''
   A civil suit filed against Mrs. Kelly provides a glimpse into
what kind of case the prosecution could present.
   ``We anticipate that some of the children will testify, some of
parents will testify and counselors will testify,'' said C. Everett
Thompson II, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the negligence
suit. The suit has been put on hold at the request of prosecutors.
   Some of the children are still troubled, Thompson said.
   ``They're going through therapy, they're getting treatment,'' he
said. ``We think it will be a long time before we really know the
extent of the damage and the scarring that occurred to these
children.''

   Rascal, a dolphin rescued from a cold
Virginia bay after failing to migrate to warmer waters, is going
home after five weeks of Southern hospitality.
   The dolphin gained 30 pounds on a diet of smelt and herring and
is healthy enough to be returned to the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday,
Becca Moore, a spokeswoman for Sea World in Orlando, Fla., said
Tuesday.
   Rascal also was treated for parasites during his stay, she said.
   The 2- to 3-year-old mammal, which is 7{ feet long and weighs 356
pounds, will be taken by van to Cape Canaveral and then carried by
boat 20 miles offshore for release, Ms. Moore said.
   ``The area is known to be inhabited by populations of coastal
dolphins,'' she said. ``We're hoping to find a nice group of
dolphins to release him in.''
   The National Marine Fisheries Service appproved the release. The
federal agency also authorized Rascal's rescue from Broad Bay at
Virginia Beach last month.
   Bay residents had noticed the animal refused to migrate south
with other dolphins last fall. The dolphin eluded rescuers in
December, but Sea World officials called in in February quickly
netted Rascal and flew him to Florida.
   Ms. Moore said the dolphin's fin will be marked with two parallel
lines applied painlessly with an extremely cold instrument.
   ``We will not officially be tracking him, but it is a marking
that we wanted to include in case people are spotting him,'' she
said.

   A seventh arrest has been made in a sexual
abuse case in which at least 70 children were believed molested by
day-care workers.
   The latest arrest came Tuesday, nearly a year after an
investigation of the Little Rascals Day Care Center began. A sixth
person was arrested Monday.
   Robin Boles Byrum, 19, of Edenton, was jailed on $500,000 bail
on charges including taking indecent liberties with a minor and
conspiracy.
   In the months since the first allegations were made, wave after
wave of indictments have been handed up. Court documents say
day-care workers in 1988 and 1989 had sex in front of children and
had sex with youngsters.
   The initial reports were based on evidence from 21 children who
were allegedly molested, but prosecutors said in court papers filed
in November that more than 70 children, ages 2 through 7, were
abused in some way.
   The day-care center in this town of 5,800 on the Albemarle Sound
lost its license in June and was closed. The first arrest was in
April.
   On Monday, Darlene Harris, 25, was jailed on $75,000 bail on
charges including conspiracy and taking indecent liberties with a
minor. District Attorney H.P. Williams said she had taken
photographs of adults participating in sexual acts with children at
the center.
   Robert F. Kelly Jr., 41, who owned the center with his wife,
Elizabeth T. Kelly, is jailed on $1.5 million bail, his wife on $1
million.
   The investigation was triggered by a complaint to social
services authorities department by an person not identified by
investigators.
   Little Rascals had been considered one of the best day-care
centers in the area. Its enrollment changed daily, with 25 to 40
children cared for each day.

<TEXT>
   A bottlenose dolphin has become stranded in
the chilly waters off Virginia Beach after failing to migrate south
this fall, and authorities are planning a risky rescue to try to
reunite it with its brethren.
   The dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, was spotted in early October in
Broad Bay, and residents around the bay began requesting that the
government do something to save it.
   On Monday, the National Marine Fisheries Service agreed that the
animal's life was in jeopardy and that an attempt should be made to
save it.
   ``It's only done in extreme circumstances when the welfare of the
animal is believed to be in danger,'' said Bob Stone, special agent
with the service in Newport News.
   Kathy Read, a diving instructor at the bay, said Rascal has
slowed down and become thinner. ``That's probably due to the food
source probably drying up out there,'' she said.
   Divers hope to go into the bay Wednesday, trap the aquatic mammal
and then deliver him for a flight to warmer waters off the Carolinas
or Georgia.
   Earlier this fall, the plight of three whales icebound off Alaska
attracted worldwide attention. One of the whales died, but the other
two made it to open water after a Soviet icebreaker carved a path
for them.
   Rascal's rescue is to be supervised by Robert Schoelkopf,
director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, N.J.,
because he has captured dolphins before, Stone said.
   The Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point had
opposed an attempt to capture the dolphin, saying it could drown in
the net or take in water and develop pneumonia. Bob Byrne, associate
director for research at the institute, said today that it will work
with Schoelkopf on the rescue effort.
   Schoelkopf agreed that a rescue is risky.
   ``You weigh that against the ultimate fate of the animal if
nothing's done,'' he said. ``That animal would die in the area if we
didn't do anything.''
   The dolphin is the second to become stranded in the bay in three
years. Schoelkopf oversaw that rescue three years ago and helped
save dolphins off the North Carolina coast several years ago. An
attempted rescue of a dolphin in Delaware a few years ago failed
when the animal died of a heart attack, he said.
   Rascal may fare better, he said, because apparently it is young.
   Residents have said the animal may not have joined other dolphins
in migrating south because it was frightened of bridge construction
in a narrow channel that links the bay and open water.

   Like many other citizens these days, Spuds MacKenzie has grown concerned about pit bulls. 

   Not that the Bud Light "Senior Party Consultant" worries about having his leg chomped off. 
Rather, some people have been making, well, insinuations. 

   They're suggesting that though he may wear tuxedos and appear on talk shows, when you get right down to it, Mr. MacKenzie may actually be a. . . . 


   "Absolutely not! 
Spuds is not a pit bull," says William Stolberg, a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch Cos., which uses the dog to sell beer. 
"Spuds is an original. 
He's an executive." 

   But amid the recent flurry of charges about the dangers of American pit bull terriers, few dogs have avoided suspicion. 
Even famous canines like Nipper, the RCA Victor dog; Petie, of "Little Rascals"; and Buster Brown's dog, Tige, are being scrutinized. 

   Employees and customers have been calling the dogs' masters demanding to know if the celebrity canines are really pit bulls. 
The masters say the suspicions result from erroneous media portrayals. 

   USA Today, for example, editorialized that pit bulls have changed since Nipper's prime (and now deserve names like Killer, Ripper and Chopper). 
A New York Newsday headline read: "Petie the Pit Bull." 

   "The truth of the matter is, Petie is a lovable mutt and not a vicious dog," says a spokesman for King World Productions Inc., syndicator of "Little Rascals," in which Petie began appearing in the '20s. 

   A spokesman for General Electric Co., RCA's parent, says Nipper is a fox terrier, not a pit bull -- though he concedes the dog got its name "from nipping at people's heels." 
Kent C. Robinson, chief executive of Buster Brown Apparel, says, "We're sure a dog as wise and loving as Tige is not a pit bull." 
Besides, Tige was just a cartoon character, never a real dog. 

   As for Spuds, Mr. Stolberg says that if he were a dog and not an executive, he "would prefer to be an English bull terrier (his actual breed) because they are extremely cool and mellow." 
For people worried about Spuds's bloodlines, Anheuser-Busch even sends out a formal statement on the distinction between English bull terriers and pit bulls. (The company strongly denies reports that Mr. MacKenzie is pregnant; as to whether he is actually a she, Mr. Stolberg says only that Spuds "likes to keep his privacy.") 

   While the name-calling may annoy the dogs' masters, others have tried to turn it to their advantage. 
GE's spokesman says he has been contacted by several pit bull owners' groups seeking confirmation that Nipper is a pit bull. 
"They were trying to ride on Nipper's image," he says. 
"We told them they were barking up the wrong tree."

   Mayor Sonny Bono says he's thinking
of taking his political act on the road - to Washington.
   ``If I made a move, I would decide for the Senate,'' said the
former restaurateur, singer, television star and husband of
Oscar-winning actress Cher.
   ``At this point,'' he said Thursday, ``I have to really question
whether for another four years I want to just continue being mayor
of Palm Springs.''
   Bono said he had talked with Sen. Pete Wilson, ``about going
beyond this point in politics.''
   If Wilson, a Republican, wins his bid for governor, he would be
in a position to choose his own Senate replacement.
   Bono, also a Republican, returned Wednesday from a promotional
trip for his new line of chocolate chip cookies.

   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - George ``Spanky'' McFarland, the former
child star of ``Our Gang'' and ``Little Rascals,'' says he deserves
about $100,000 from a bar that had used a logo depicting a chubby
boy in a beanie.
   Federal Judge James Rosenbaum on Thursday ordered the saloon,
now called Checker's Nightclub and formerly Spanky's Saloon, not to
use the ``visage or name'' of Spanky. It's not enough for
McFarland.
   Drawings of a round-faced kid wearing the beanie came down from
the front of the building and from interior walls. Patrons no
longer can buy jackets, T-shirts and hats imprinted with the
Spanky's Saloon logo.
   Other businesses pay McFarland, 62, who lives in Fort Worth,
Texas, for the right to use his name and childhood face. McFarland
wants similar retroactive payments from the owner and former
co-owner of the St. Paul bar.
   ``He's after 5 percent of their gross profits for 13 years and
that's an exorbitant amount of money, even if they did something
wrong,'' said Dennis Johnson, a lawyer for the bar's former owner,
Michael Kalis.
   Kalis sold his interest in the bar to his partner, Walter
Engelhardt, in 1982.
   Johnson and Engelhardt, who represented himself in court,
contend the bar's name had little to do with its business and that
the connection with McFarland was unintentional.
   ``If every kid with a beanie on his head is him, this country is
in trouble,'' Engelhardt said last year. ``If there were actual
pictures of him here, I could understand, but not when it's just
some fat-faced kid.''
   Rosenbaum urged attorneys to work out an agreement regarding the
merchandise and took McFarland's other claims under advisement.

   SEATTLE (AP) - A leukemia victim whose search for a perfect bone
marrow match inspired 50,000 people to offer theirs was recovering
Friday after leaving the hospital.
   Allison Atlas, 20, was discharged from the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center's bone marrow transplant floor Thursday,
about a month after receiving marrow from her mother.
   She went to an apartment near the center that her family has
rented since they came to the area for her treatment this summer.
   ``She's at day 36 (after the transplant) today and she will not
be going home until she's at day 100'' or so, said the center's
spokeswoman, Susan Edmonds.
   It will be six months to a year before it is known if her immune
system has returned to normal.
   ``The bone marrow graft is well established and functioning
appropriately,'' said Dr. David Peace, one of Miss Atlas'
physicians. ``At this time, there is no evidence of recurrent
disease.''
   The transplant was conducted after her diseased marrow was
destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation. A nationwide search for a
perfectly matched marrow donor brought 50,000 would-be
contributors, but none were suitable for her.
   Miss Atlas, from Bethesda, Md., was a student at New York
University before she became ill.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Singer-songwriter Paul Anka and his wife are
suing their former attorney for allegedly giving bad tax and
financial advice, court documents show.
   The lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges
that Albert A. Rettig cost Paul and Anne Anka hundreds of thousands
of dollars in back taxes and fines and ``threatens to cause the
Ankas more than $600,000 in additional damages.''
   Anka's writing and recording career has spanned four decades and
includes hits such as ``Lonely Boy,'' ``Puppy Love,'' ``She's a
Lady,'' and ``My Way,'' made famous by Frank Sinatra.
   Rettig, the Anka attorney and accountant for 30 years, was fired
in June. Rettig's law and accounting associates also are named in
the suit.
   A woman who answered the phone at Rettig's Beverly Hills home
said he was out of the country and could not be reached for
comment.
   The Ankas, residents of Nevada, say that Rettig did not tell
them that they would have to pay income tax if they spend more than
nine months in California.
   In 1988, the California Franchise Tax Board, billed Anne Anka
for $400,000 in state income tax because she had spent more than
nine months in Carmel. Paul Anka is a Canadian citizen.
   The Ankas appealed following Rettig's advice and had to pay an
additional $100,000, the couple claimed in the lawsuit. Court
documents say the Ankas claim Rettig ignored letters from the state
tax board asking that he file the taxes.

   Robert Winckler, an entertainment lawyer
whose Hollywood career began as a child actor on the ``Our Gang''
film comedies, has died of stomach cancer, his son said. He was 62.
   Winckler died Dec. 28 at his home in Woodland Hills, the Los
Angeles Daily News reported Thursday.
   Winckler's acting career began at age 9 at Hal Roach Studios,
after Charlie Chaplin's former wife, Mildred, provided him with a
letter of introduction.
   By the late 1930s, he had appeared as the bully in at least
eight Little Rascals features. He also was cast in numerous films,
appearing in ``Boys Town,'' ``Knute Rockne _ All American,'' ``Blue
Montana Skies,'' and ``Stagecoach.''
   Winckler graduated from the Southwestern University School of
Law in 1953, and subsequently represented stars such as George
``Spanky'' McFarland and Billy Barty.
   Recently, Winckler had been representing Adam West, the former
television star of ``Batman,'' in a lawsuit against several
advertising agencies over the alleged imitation of West's Batman in
a television commercial.
   West is seeking $900,000 in damages over a commercial for Zayre
Stores. The case was taken over by other attorneys and will go to
trial Monday, said Winckler's son, Bill Winckler.
   In addition to his son, Winckler is survived by his wife of 27
years, Betty, and daughter Patricia Winckler, all of Woodland Hills.

<TEXT>     This tendency exists whether we're talking about a growing family or a

For businesses, that can be deadly. Continuing to do the same things in the
same ways while the world around you is changing can become an express ticket
to bankruptcy court.;    So, successful businesses put mechanisms in place to
shake themselves up, to literally upset themselves, whenever complacency sets
it. Successful businesses see to it that they always have a few rascals on
board. Rascals are employees whose natural tendency and ability is to foster
dissatisfaction, even subversion, when the doldrums set in.;    According to
Lundberg, rascals come in several persuasions. For example, adventurers tend
to work outside established structures -- making their own schedules, finding
their own workplaces, exploring and using technology to find new things to do
and new ways to do them.;    Authenticators are known for the high value they
place on candidness and truth. Unafraid to "tell it like it is," they often
embarrass the company clones around them with their passionate, on-target
observations.;    It is because, not despite, the fact that they are different
that these employees serve as catalysts for change, change that is essential

   Roseanne Barr faces a lawsuit that claims she
paid ``thugs'' $50 to beat a celebrity photographer as he took
pictures of her.
   Ralph Dominguez claims in a Superior Court suit filed Monday that
he was photographing the star of the hit TV series ``Roseanne'' in
her car outside the trendy restaurant Spago on July 14 when the
beating took place.
   The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, said several men
approached the car Ms. Barr was in and spoke with her. She allegedly
paid them $50, after which they began to beat the photographer,
according to the suit.
   Ms. Barr, who plays an earthy, sarcastic housewife in
``Roseanne,'' had no comment on the lawsuit, said her publicist Lisa
Kasteler.
   No criminal charges were filed but West Hollywood sheriff's
deputies were investigating.

   The boy with a beanie painted on the wall
outside Spanky's Saloon is ``just some fat-faced kid,'' its owner
says. But George ``Spanky'' McFarland thinks it's him.
   The lawyer for the star of ``Our Gang'' and ``Little Rascals''
movies from 50 years ago sued in U.S. District Court on Thursday,
insisting the boy is McFarland, a 60-year-old businessman in Fort
Worth, Texas.
   The lawsuit accuses bar owner Walter Engelhardt of
misappropriating McFarland's name, identity and likeness without
permission or compensation. McFarland is seeking damages of more
than $50,000 and a court order prohibiting Engelhardt from using
McFarland's name and image.
   McFarland makes personal appearances as the grown-up Spanky.
   Engelhardt said that besides the boy painted outside his rock
music saloon, two other representations of the bar's namesake are
inside: a Spanky on a wooden plaque and a neon light depicting
Spanky with orange hair. All three look different and none
represents Spanky McFarland, he said.
   ``I must have missed the (movie) where he had orange hair,''
Engelhardt said. ``If every kid with a beanie on his head is him,
this country is in trouble. If there were actual pictures of him
here, I could understand, but not when it's just some fat-faced
kid.''

   After that stage is completed, the rehearsal set is to be
transported to Toronto, where the Stones have a Sept. 3 concert date.
   Ron Bond, the city's deputy recreation commissioner and manager
of the stadium, said that even though the city decided fire code and
other safety problems prevented a concert attended by 100,000 fans
at JFK Stadium, a rehearsal on the field would be safe.

   A graying and glib Paul McCartney formally
announced an international concert tour that he hopes will attract
both misty-eyed Beatlemaniacs and a new generation of fans.
   ``There was a time when you thought music equals youth. I don't
think that applies anymore,'' said McCartney, 47, joining other
middle-aged rockers on tour this year _ the Who, the Rolling Stones
and former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.
   Asked on Thursday if he was touring to avoid being ``left out,''
he replied, ``I suppose there's an element of that ... but it's not
my prime reason for going out.''
   Instead, he credited the continual touring of the Grateful Dead
and its leader, Jerry Garcia, with inspiring his first tour since
1976. ``If Jerry can still do it that good, there's hope for us
all,'' McCartney said.
   McCartney also said several nieces and nephews have asked him:
``Please play, because we weren't there the first time around.''
   The tour opens with three shows at the Los Angeles Forum Nov.
27-28-29.

   Charley Pride's golf game may not be as
smooth as his singing, but the veteran country and western star
still is succeeding on and off the course.
   As a co-sponsor of the Sunwest Bank-Charley Pride Senior Tour
Tournament, Pride has helped raise more than $447,000 during the
past three tournaments to help four Albuquerque hospitals.
   Pride, a former baseball player in the Negro American League
before making it big in Nashville, performs annually at a pair of
shows and also plays in the pro-am competition that accompanies the
regular tournament.
   ``I need to play more and get more consistent, but that's what
everybody says, isn't it?'' said Pride, who has a 10 handicap.
   Pride, who describes his age as ``plenty nine,'' has been playing
golf 25 years.
   His singing career also continues to thrive, with his latest
single, ``Amy's Eyes,'' scheduled for release soon.

If voters impose Proposition 140's severe term-limits on the California 
Legislature, its members will have themselves to blame. They gerrymandered 
their districts so effectively during the 1980s that they made it extremely 
difficult for voters to displace them. 
</P>
<P>
Term limits are not a good answer to the problem, but voters now seem likely to 
seize on the proposal as their only way of throwing the rascals out. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of across-the-board term limits, the right reform would be to eliminate 
gerrymandering and to create districts in which both parties had a chance to 
win and voters had better opportunities to defeat incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
But repeated efforts to reform the redistricting process failed during the 
1980s. The Democratic legislative leadership -- with the quiet approval of some 
Republican legislators who like the status quo even if it means being the 
long-term minority party -- financed misleading campaigns that distorted the 
redistricting issues and hoodwinked voters into defeating reform initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to defeat Proposition 140, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and 
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti have hired the same consulting team of 
Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino, whose campaigns of deceit and distortion 
persuaded voters to turn down redistricting reform measures. It will be much 
harder to obfuscate the issues this time, however: Voters are much more likely 
to grasp the idea behind term limits -- throwing the rascals out, even if it 
has the unfortunate effect of throwing out some decent and useful lawmakers 
along with the rascals.

   Frances Woodworth Wright, a Harvard
University astronomer who taught celestial navigation to Navy
officers, died of cancer Sunday at age 92.
   During more than half a century of research and teaching,
Wright's studies ranged from investigating specks of cosmic dust
called spherules to calculating the brightness of galaxies and
developing efforts to observe comets and meteors.
   Her special interest was celestial navigation, the guiding of
ships by the stars. Among her students were Army engineers and Navy
officers enrolled in special courses during World War II. She also
taught Harvard undergraduates and weekend sailors and wrote three
books on sailing by the stars.
   Wright taught astronomy and mathematics at Elmira College in New
York before going to Harvard in 1928 to serve as an assistant to a
succession of prominent astronomers, including Cecilia
Payne-Gaposchkin, Harlow Shapley and Fred Whipple.
   She earned a doctorate in astronomy from Radcliffe College in
1958.

   Frederic Ernest Morrison, who was already an
acting veteran when he joined the original ``Little Rascals''
comedy team nearly 70 years ago, died of cancer last week at age 76.
   Known as ``Sunshine Sammy,'' Morrison appeared regularly on
stage and in films during the '20s, '30s and '40s before leaving
show business to become quality control inspector in the aerospace
industry.
   Rediscovered by ``Little Rascals'' fans nearly 30 years later,
he went on to make guest appearances in the 1970s on such TV shows
as ``The Jeffersons'' and ``Good Times.''
   Morrison broke into acting at age 3 in a series of Baby Marie
Osbourne films. ``The Sunshine Sammy Series,'' which followed,
lasted only one episode, but Hal Roach saw him in it and cast him
as a Little Rascal in 1922.
   Morrison, the oldest of the group, appeared in 28 episodes
before leaving two years later to do vaudeville in New York City.
He returned to Hollywood in the 1940s, appearing regularly in
``Dead End Kids'' and ``East Side Kids'' movies.
   Morrison was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in
1987.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Fat rascals rescue the US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN tourists worried that their currency will not stretch to three
meals a day in over-priced Britain can rest assured: a thin dollar still
buys a fat rascal.
Hungry Americans can find the cake-cum-scone at Taylors Tea Rooms in York,
where they sell for only Pounds 1.85 each. A mere Pounds 3.20 will buy a
Palace Ploughmans (bread, cheese and salad) at the Crystal Palace pub in
Bath.
With American tourists wincing at British prices, the British Tourist
Authority has come up with some less-than-overwhelming illustrations of how
affordable Britain is.
The culinary bargains cited above appear in a book called Amazing Britain -
How to have an amazingly affordable holiday in Britain this year. The BTA is
handing out 250,000 free copies in the US.
The book sings the praises of Norwich ('An amazing corner of East Anglia'),
Stratford-upon-Avon ('Where the Bard comes amazingly to life') and Glasgow
('An amazingly cultural city').
But it is London which is the main UK attraction.
The BTA says it has carried out a survey of 17 cities which found that
London was only the eleventh most expensive, being cheaper than cities like
Tokyo, Rome, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. When it came to
shopping, the BTA claimed London was the cheapest of the lot. Mr William
Davis, the BTA chairman, said yesterday that London 'is still one of the
greatest capitals in the world.' But he wrote in the authority's annual
report: 'There is no doubt that people's desire to visit Britain is largely
determined by their image of London, which regretably, has become more than
a little tired, even tarnished.' Amazing Britain invokes DH Lawrence, who
once said: 'The English . . . are the nicest people in the world . . .' but
says this now applies equally to the Scots and Welsh. Amazing.

<TEXT>
   Veterans of successful efforts to limit
the number of years lawmakers stay in office offered advice
Thursday on how to throw the rascals out. Lesson No. 1: Don't call
'em rascals.
   ``Most of them aren't rascals,'' said Colorado state Sen. Terry
Considine, who backed his state's term-limiting law. ``They come to
it (lawmaking) with a good heart.''
   Considine spoke at a daylong conference attended by more than
100 people from at least 20 states who say they are part of a
growing national movement to get rid of the ``career lawmaker.''
   ``People are organizing in all 50 states,'' said Paul Beckner,
executive director of Citizens for Congressional Reform in
Washington, D.C., another conference panelist. ``It's clear we have
a broad-based movement.''
   Considine's panel comprised political activists who led
victorious campaigns to limit the terms and re-election bids of
legislators in California, Colorado and Oklahoma.
   Negative campaigns are tempting but unwise, they said. Recent
history offers the best illustration. Despite widespread anger at
politicians for such blunders as the savings and loan crisis,
voters across the country in 1990 reelected 97 percent of
incumbents running for state and congressional offices.
   Instead, the activists said, campaigns to limit service in the
state houses and Congress should emphasize a return to a citizen
legislature: the people's government intended by the nation's
founders.
   ``What we need is citizen legislators who call it like they see
it then return home to their real jobs,'' sais Considine.
   The movement, if it is one, has a sense of humor. In Oregon the
effort to limit lawmakers' tenure goes by the slogan: Let
Incumbents Mosey Into The Sunset, or LIMITS.
   Ed Crane, president of the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.,
which does policy analysis, said the public no longer wants career
legislators but people who view service as their civic duty.
   ``What we want are people in a citizen legislature who view
themselves as on a leave of absence from their real jobs,'' Crane
said. ``This movement is an opportunity for Americans to regain
control of their government.''
   Crane warned that the grass roots movement, though widely
supported, could be hurt if politicians support it. That includes
President Bush, who will call for limits on congressional terms
during his State of the Union address next month. That was
disclosed earlier this week by Chief of Staff John Sununu, though
he didn't give specifics.
   ``It would be much better if the movement were citizen-led,'' he
said. ``Bush and (Vice President Dan) Quayle did real damage when
they came to this state to support Proposition 140.''
   Colorado voters this year approved limits of eight years in
office for members of both chambers of their state legislature.
They also approved a limit of 12 years in office for their U.S.
senators and representatives. The first such initiative to deal
with jobs in Congress, conference organizers said.
   The California referendum, which passed in November with 52
percent of the vote, set limits of three two-year terms for
Assembly members and two four-year terms for state senators. The
law also limited state executives, including the governor, to two
four-year terms.
   In Oklahoma this year voters approved a limit of 12 years in
office for their state lawmakers.

  [Text] According to military sources, the South Korean 
puppets conducted provocative gun firing [tobalchogin chongpo 
sagyok haengwirul kamhaeng] on 28 February near the DMZ in the 
frontline in front of us, agitating [chaguk] us. 
  The puppet army's large-caliber artillery group, moved and 
deployed in Yulli-ri and Waechon-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, 
Kangwon Province, South Korea, showered tens of shells on the 
area near the DMZ that day. The puppet army's armed rascals 
occupied battle positions in Sogong-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi 
Province and Korangpo-ri, Yonchon County and created a stir by 
firing at random as many as some 2,000 shells of large-caliber 
machine guns and automatic rifles, while advancing toward the 
Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. 
  On the same day, the South Korean puppets openly and in 
broad 
daylight moved and deployed some 10 armored cars and many armed 
rascals near the DMZ in the north of Kajon-ri, Inje County, 
Kangwon Province, South Korea. They also mobilized hundreds of 
armed rascals to Chungse-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon 
Province, South Korea, and were immersed in a war frenzy 
[chonjaeng kwanggirul puryossumnida]. 
  Meanwhile, the puppet army's fighter-bombers flew in 
formations in the skies above Changsin-ri and Haesang-ri, Kosong 
County, Kangwon Province, South Korea and were frenzied in

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Puppets Are Accelerating Chemical </F>
War Preparations"] 
  [Text] Today our people and peaceloving people of the 
world are strongly demanding complete abolition of chemical 
weapons, in addition to nuclear weapons -- mass lethal weapons. 
  Chemical weapons, which kill and injure people by using 
poisonous chemical materials, are branded as the most cruel 
massacre weapons in the world and thus their use and development 
have been prohibited by international commitments. 
  Only traitor Kim Yong-sam, who hangs out the signboard of 
civilian politics, is openly pursuing possession of chemical 
weapons. 
  This shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is going to 
openly perpetrate not only nuclear war, but also chemical war, 
against fellow countrymen. We cannot but regard it as very 
grave. As has already been known, successive ruling bunches have 
produced and stockpiled chemical weapons from long ago. There 
are more than 40 underground nuclear warehouses and underground 
chemical weapon warehouses in areas around Mt. Kyeryong in South 
Chungchong Province and in the area near Suwon, Kyonggi 
Province. Many ion chemical weapons, known as malicious mass 
lethal weapons, are stockpiled there. 
  While talking about possession of independent chemical 
warfare capability, former South Korean dictators built more 
than 10 poisonous gas plants in South Korea and produced a great 
number of chemical weapons. 
  The rascals brought from the United States on a large scale 
military aircraft capable of dropping chemical bombs and 155-mm 
[word indistinct] guns capable of firing the bombs. They also 
purchased gas masks on a pretext of preparing for chemical 
warfare. 
  A chemical, biological, and radiological unit school has 
been 
operating in the puppet Army for a long time to train 
professional chemical warfare experts. 
  By loudly raving that chemical warfare has become a 
worldwide 
trend, the former puppet warmongers exhibited various chemical 
equipment they produced and even propagandized its superiority. 
  The Team Spirit joint military exercise, conducted every 
year 
in South Korea, has become an important leverage to achieve not 
only the nuclear war plan, but also the rascals' chemical war 
plan. New chemical war equipment was mobilized in the recent 
Team Spirit joint military exercise and units specializing in 
chemical war training participated in the exercise. 
  Reporting on the true aspect of chemical war exercises 
conducted during the Team Spirit joint military exercise several 
years ago, a South Korean broadcast said that in addition to 
aircraft attacks on simulated areas in the North side, smoke 
bombs, chemical shells, bacterial shells, and even explosive 
shells, were dropped during the exercise. As the result, all 
living things can barely survive. 
  Just as former dictators, puppet Kim Yong-sam, who claims to 
be a civilian politician in South Korea, is also scheming to 
inflict, not only nuclear disaster, but also poisonous gas 
calamity on fellow countrymen by clinging to the sleeves of 
outside forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in a so-called conference of 
offices and agencies concerned, decided to possess chemical 
weapons and to submit the bill to National Assembly for 
ratification. 
  This clearly shows how frantically the rascals are running 
amok with chemical war preparations. 
  Going against the trend of the time toward disarmament and 
detente, the civilian warmongers are accelerating production of 
chemical weapons -- mass lethal weapons the use of which is 
prohibited worldwide -- and are attempting to inflict the 
disaster of chemical weapons on fellow countrymen. Their crime 
will not be pardoned forever. 
  The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam should give up criminal 
chemical war preparations and should act with discretion. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in spite of the warnings 
of our people and the people of the world, is advancing along 
the road of continuously committing antinational maneuvers to 
accelerate preparation of nuclear war and chemical war on the 
Korean peninsula in collusion with outside forces, the rascals 
cannot avoid the responsibility for all consequences arising 
therefrom nor can they evade the stern judgment of history.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Human Rights Infringer's </F>
Ballad on the Respect of Human Life"] 
  [Text] The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam held a so-called 
report meeting on life reforms on 7 January. Talking about life 
reforms, he raved that the spirit of respecting human life 
should be put into practice and that many people must not be 
made lawbreakers because of unrealistic legal systems. The 
rascal raved that the people should actually feel the success of 
life reforms within a year at the most. This is another 
brazen-faced mockery of the people, which can be raved by 
traitor Kim Yong-sam, that is, the political impostor well 
versed in fraud, trickery, cheating, and machination. 
  To renovate the spirit of respect for human life in South 
Korea, the colonial fascist rule should, above all, be put to an 
end. Fascist vicious laws, including the National Security Law, 
which systematically infringes upon the people's freedom and 
rights; and suppressive organizations, such as the police, 
prosecution, and the Agency for National Security Planning 
[NSP], and the Defense Security Command should be abrogated and 
dissolved. Then new laws and organizations centered on the 
people should come into being. Otherwise, the spirit of 
respecting human life cannot be displayed. 
  In fact, even today, that is, the era of respecting human 
life, human dignity, and freedom have been fully trampled 
underfoot in South Korea. It is in South Korea where youths, 
students, and patriotic figures who struggled for independence, 
democracy, and reunification, have been secretly assassinated 
and dumped into rivers and seas. It is also in the rotten South 
Korea where husbands kill wives and vice versa, sons and 
daughters kill parents and secretly bury them, and traffickers 
in human flesh for a little money prevail. The worst human 
right infringement activity has been committed by the Kim 
Yong-sam ring babbling about respecting human rights. 
  Under the pretext of a civilian regime, the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet ring is suppressing the people more mercilessly than at 
the time of the military dictatorial regimes. By mobilizing the 
police, the puppet ring trampled underfoot the workers who 
staged sit-ins calling for the right for subsistence last year. 
It mercilessly suppressed youths, students, and citizens 
calling for revealing the truth behind the Kwangju incident and 
punishing those responsible for the Kwangju incident, by 
mobilizing approximately 100,000 policemen. The number of 
people who were injured by the police is more than three times 
those injured at the time of the Sixth Republic. This shows 
that the Kim Yong-sam puppet ring is mercilessly suppressing the 
people. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam raved that many fellow countrymen must 
not be made lawbreakers because of an unrealistic legal system. 
This is also a brazen-faced maneuver. Many kinds of vicious 
laws, which can be applicable under any circumstances, exist in 
South Korea. The National Security Law is the most vicious law 
of all laws. 
  It goes without saying that the National Security Law is an 
unrealistic one in view of the background of the enacted law and 
its reactionary characteristics. For this reason, the South 
Korean people have strongly demanded that the National Security 
Law--the vicious fascist law against democracy and 
reunification--be rescinded. 
  However, the Kim Yong-sam ring has aggravated North-South 
relations and arrested and persecuted many people by brandishing 
this law. This nonetheless, he had the face of raving that many 
fellow countrymen must not be made lawbreakers because of an 
unrealistic legal system. How brazen-faced the rascal is! 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam babbled about the spirit of respecting 
human life from the beginning of the new year. The reason he 
spat out such words is clear. As everyone knows, since traitor 
Kim Yong-sam seized power under the pretext of a civilian-regime 
president, he has babbled about the improvement of human rights 
and the development of democracy. Even though one year has 
passed since he seized power, nothing has changed in South 
Korea. Vicious fascist laws, including the National Security 
Law, which is a legal and systematic device for infringing upon 
human rights, have existed as they are or have been turned for 
the worse. The NSP, the hotbed of human right infringement, has 
remained intact. 
  In addition, the rulers' infringements of human rights are 
more prevalent than those of the time of the Fifth and Sixth 
Republics. Thus, people cannot breathe to their heart's content. 
  The so-called civilian regime's color was clearly brought to 
light. The people, who have been deceived by the rascals' 
ballad of reform, are trying to rise up to struggle against the 
rulers. Taken by surprise, traitor Kim Yong-sam is trying once 
again to deceive the people and maintain power by means of the 
ballad on human rights. It is unreasonable to babble about the 
respect of human life in South Korea--a land barren of democracy 
and a living hell-- where human rights have been fully trampled 
underfoot. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring should abrogate and dissolve 
the 
vicious fascist laws, including the National Security Law, and 
the other suppression organizations, including the NSP; should 
stop suppressing the people; and should immediately release all 
patriotic figures who have been illegally arrested.

   The struggle for hearts and minds in the black community,
which ultimately will be more important than the civil-rights
bill Congress is debating, has recently grown a lot more
complicated.
   Growing numbers of blacks are calling for self-help,
independence, progress through education and black
enterprise. In Milwaukee, for example, state legislator Polly
Williams conceived a school voucher program for the poor. Bob
Woodson, who has led an effort to convert public housing to
tenant ownership, this week was awarded a MacArthur
Fellowship, known in some quarters as "the genius grant."
Former EEOC head Clarence Thomas, now a federal judge, and
economists like Thomas Sowell voice similar sentiments.
Shelby Steele, an essayist and teacher, has lately garnered
considerable attention for writting on race and the harm done
by affirmative-action programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, grass-roots members of the black community are
showing some impatience with racism as the all-purpose excuse
for misbehavior, and with calls for racial solidarity at all
costs. Most especially, as the trial of Washington Mayor
Marion Barry accumulates evidence of drug use, a recent poll
showed blacks viewing the mayor negatively by a margin of 47%
to 19%.
   On the other side are the militants who are calling,
essentially, for a new black separatism. They include people
like minister Louis Farrakhan, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and
lawyers Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox, who gave us the Tawana
Brawley story. Include in this number, also, those calling
for an Afro-centered school curriculum for black children.
   Both groups pose challenges to traditional civil-rights
groups. Perhaps inevitably, that challenge has led to some
confusion -- the sort that was on display last week at the
NAACP's 81st annual convention, particularly by NAACP head
Benjamin Hooks. Throughout his career, Mr. Hooks has been
nothing if not eloquent about the responsibilities of black
leaders and image-makers. To take just one example, he
recently delivered a scathing denunciation of 2 Live Crew,
excoriating them particularly for trying to "wrap the mantle
of black cultural experience" around their "vicious and
sadistic" works. And in the course of his speech, Mr. Hooks
strongly attacked those who would use racism as an alibi for
the ills of the black community, and called for "a moratorium
on excuses."
   Yet in his fire-and-brimstone speech, Mr. Hooks charged
that black elected officials were being subjected to
victimization and harassment, comparable to the post-Civil
War Reconstruction era. The victimized official he apparently
had in mind was none other than Mayor Barry, whose
prosecution Mr. Hooks presented as a typical instance of
racial harassment, despite evidence that is nothing short of
overwhelming.
   Matters became still more confusing when at the same
convention, Mr. Hooks lashed out at black scholars who have
pointed out the harms that accompany affirmative action.
Referring to the scholars as "some of the biggest liars the
world ever saw," Mr. Hooks told a reporter, "They're just a
new breed of Uncle Toms as far as I'm concerned." Mr. Hooks
said he particularly resented one "lowdown dirty rascal" for
writing "a big story in a white magazine."
   The particular dirty rascal Mr. Hooks seems to have had in
mind was Professor Steele, who recently wrote a piece
published in the New York Times Magazine. In it, Mr. Steele
argued forcefully against racial-entitlement programs. He
noted that racial-preference programs did not teach skills or
educate, but that they did "encourage blacks to exploit their
victimization" while also stigmatizing them with an implied
inferiority.
   Mr. Hooks offers a melange of black attitudes, but it is
not clear for whom he actually speaks. Other influential
blacks were quick to take issue with some of his statements.
Columnist Carl Rowan wrote that Mr. Hooks encouraged
thousands of black youngsters at that convention "to wallow
in the absurd notion" that Mayor Barry was on trial because
of selective prosecution of black leaders. Is this
leadership, Mr. Rowan asked, "Or is it pandering to black
frustrations and hatred that are being fanned by Farrakhan
and those of his mentality?"
   The confusion coming out of the NAACP convention is part
of a larger ferment that signals an important turn in the
road toward black progress, and one that is a lot more
significant than the rhetoric wafted about the halls of
Congress. Over the past generation, blacks in general and the
NAACP in particular have won important and well-deserved
victories. But surely there's room for more players and new
thinking when as earnest a leader as Mr. Hooks finds himself,
in the name of the black community, attacking Professor
Steele and defending Mayor Barry.

   A national grassroots drive to oust incumbent
politicians may have failed this election year, but its founder
said Thursday he is already looking ahead to the 1992 elections.
   ``We're going to take a look at what we did wrong and how we can
make it better. Then it's back to business,'' Jack Gargan said.
``Now we have the funding, credibility - and two years.''
   Gargan said his group, ``Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out'' or
THRO, intends to buy a full-page advertisement in USA Today to
thank supporters nationwide, then begin looking toward 1992 and
races for president and Congress.
   ``We're going to say `thank you, America' and let folks know
we're going for bear in '92,'' he said.
   Gargan said a national taxpayer association representative told
him Thursday that Tuesday's races involving incumbents were roughly
12 percent closer than had been predicted.
   ``When you can go from a dead stop in 132 days and make a 12
percent impact with no staff, no funding and no experience, it's
heartwarming,'' he said.
   Gargan, 59, who is a financial planner, formed the non-profit
THRO in June and targeted members of Congress as irresponsible
spenders to be voted out. He used $9,000 in retirement money to buy
a full-page local newspaper advertisement headlined: ``I'm mad as
hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!''
   Since then, he said he's received about $600,000 in
contributions and letters from more than 70,000 people. As the
money came in, he bought ads in newspapers small and large, urging
people to vote against all incumbents in all races.
   While he doesn't have final figures yet, Gargan said the
campaign war chest should have $100,000 to $200,000 left.
   ``We became sort of a threat and we forced them (incumbents) to
spend much more of that PAC (political action committee) money to
boost themselves,'' he said. ``We also made people across this
nation step back and look at who's running this country.''
   Gary Koops, spokesman for the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee in Washington, said THRO reflected the discontent of
voters nationwide who were weary of ``business as usual'' in
Congress.
   ``Many incumbents who'll be going back to Washington were scared
for their political lives,'' Koops said.
   Others - such as Hollis Friedman, a spokeswoman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington - said
the anti-incumbent sentiment was overblown.
   ``The few incumbents that did lose lost because they weren't
addressing the people's needs and interests properly and not
because people just wanted to get rid of an incumbent,'' Friedman
said.
   Robin Krivanek, Hillsborough County supervisor of elections,
said the anti-incumbent mood came through loud and clear locally.
   ``What amazed us is that there were people out there taking a
blanket approach to this campaign,'' Krivanek said. ``We had people
who had no idea of who these people were but wanted their names so
they could vote them out.''

<HEAD>Historian: Johnson Didn't Steal Election; Others Did</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lyndon Johnson didn't steal the
1948 Senate election, as a recent biography contends, but a
political boss might have rigged the election to get Johnson's
opponent, says a close Johnson associate.
   Joe B. Frantz, now a history professor, contends the election
was stolen for Johnson, possibly without his knowledge, by a
disgruntled south Texas political boss eager to derail the
opponent, Coke Stevenson.
   Johnson won the election by 87 votes out of almost a million
cast, collecting 99 percent of the south Texas vote.
   ``There's no question the election was stolen,'' Frantz said,
but he contends that political boss George Parr filched it to spite
Stevenson, not necessarily to help Johnson.
   Frantz said he revealed the information at a recent historical
society banquet because of accusations against Johnson by Robert A.
Caro in ``Means of Ascent,'' the second volume in Caro's biography
of Johnson.
   Frantz, a White House aide under Johson and former chairman of
the University of Texas history department, teaches at Corpus
Christi State University.
   Frantz put together the Oral History Project for the Johnson
Presidential Library in Austin, taping interviews with nearly 1,000
people, including Johnson's political enemies.
   He said his information about Parr's political vendetta against
Stevenson came from an interview he conducted with Stevenson when
the former governor was in his 80s. Stevenson died in 1975 at age
87.
   ``It would have been in the early 1970s,'' Frantz told The
Associated Press. ``He set me down and he said, `I'm going to give
you the straight story' ...''
   Stevenson and Parr had always been close allies, Stevenson told
Frantz, until Parr asked Stevenson, then governor, to name a
certain man judge at Laredo.
   Stevenson refused because ``the fellow was an absolute rascal
and into evey sort of political sin available,'' Frantz said.
   Parr promised revenge, the professor said.
   ``The feeling is that Parr decided, `I'm going to teach Coke
Stevenson a lesson and, at the same time, get in very good with the
new senator from Texas,''' Frantz said.
   Frantz was unable to locate Parr to interview him before Parr
died in the mid-1970s.
   Frantz said he interviewed the man responsible for disposing of
votes from a contested box before a recount could be held.
   He said he came away from the encounter convinced the south
Texans were guilty of stuffing the box, which disappeared after the
count, with illegal votes.
   ``They were a bunch of rascals,'' he said.
   Frantz said he thought Caro's characterization of Johnson in his
first volume, ``The Path to Power,'' was slanted against his
subject.
   He said that he felt that in the second book Caro expressed
annoyance ``as if Johnson had pulled off the dirtiest steal in
history. He doesn't see things in the context of the times.''
   ``We didn't know what a secret ballot was,'' Frantz said. ``I
grew up in Weatherford, and all the precincts used to vote in the
same room in the courthouse and all the courthouse hangers-on would
stand around and watch you.''
   It was not at all unusual for campaigners to know how a vote was
going before balloting ended, he said, and for people to round up

   ``I was sort of amused by Robert Caro's almost innocence in how
dirty all this was,'' said Frantz, former director of the Texas
State Historical Association. ``When the national press seized on
it, it's like he expected some sort of local paradox down here.
Actually it's no dirtier than anywhere else.''

ISN'T THE REAL WALL ST. INTERESTING ENOUGH?;

<P>
RASCAL MONEY BY JOSEPH R. GARBER (CONTEMPORARY BOOKS: $17.95; 401 PP.;

<P>
You could almost make a case that Wall Street has been ignored in literature. 
"Bonfire of the Vanities" was the first important novel on the subject to be 
published in 50 years. The last one before that was Dos Passos' "The Big Money" 
(1936). These two are the only major works that come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there's been only a smattering of minor works that could be called 
literary -- Louis Auchincloss' "The Embezzler," a satirical play called "The 
Henrietta" and a lighthearted poem, "Pan in Wall Street," all written decades 
ago, and all of which could fit into into a single briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
Upton Sinclair, who specialized in capitalism, wrote novels about the meat 
packers and the coal barons but not about the stock market, and few characters 
from fine novels ever have even worked on Wall Street. There's Nick Carraway 
from "The Great Gatsby," a bond trader, and then Tom Wolfe's bond trader -- but 
who else? No writer has done for the stockbroker what Sinclair Lewis did for 
the real-estate agent or Arthur Miller for the traveling salesman, and the last 
interesting bookkeeper to come out of a novel is Uriah Heep. 
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of Wall Street novel is curious, considering that Wall Street is 
the capital of capitalism where fortunes are won and lost every day, where 45 
million of us are directly invested and millions more are indirectly involved. 
Enough nonfiction books on investing are published each year to fill several 
library shelves, and readers have an insatiable appetite for financial stories 
in magazines. Why is it, then, that these money-making dramas are so rarely 
played out in fiction? 
</P>
<P>
One explanation is that financial maneuverings on Wall Street are so 
complicated that to describe them correctly and still hold a reader's interest 
is next to impossible. It's no problem for the how-to writer who knows he has a 
captive audience: People will slog through hundreds of incomprehensible pages 
if they think there's a profit in it. Not so with a novel. By the time you've 
explained how your main character, a futures and options speculator, hedges his 
long position by selling baskets of stocks he doesn't own, you've lost the 
narrative drive and nobody much cares what happens to him. 
</P>
<P>
A second explanation is that the people who write novels have it in their heads 
that Wall Street is very dull. I don't know where this notion got started, but 
it certainly was shared by all the participants in every creative writing class 
I took -- at Yale, even, which is a regular boot camp for Wall Street. Whenever 
we had to describe an interesting subject in 300 words or less, the subject 
always was a hot dog vendor or a lady sleeping on a park bench, and never an 
investment banker, a mergers-and-acquisitions specialist, a securities analyst. 
The professors didn't actually say Wall Street was dull, but the artsy 
viewpoint was that financial types were unromantic and shallow, not to mention 
piggy, and could hardly inspire a mediocre short essay, not to mention a 
350-page opus. 
</P>
<P>
When we went to New York on a creative-writing trip, it was not to visit Wall 
Street at the opening bell but rather the Fulton Fish market at 5 a.m. There 
was something worth being creative about. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know this for a fact, but I wouldn't be surprised if such diverse 
talents as Updike, Hemingway, Salinger and Bellow also believed that Wall 
Street was dull, or else they would have at some point put it in a story. Since 
baseball, fishing, adolescence and being Jewish appealed as subjects to these 
great writers, then Wall Street must have seemed terrifically boring for them 
to have overlooked it. 
</P>
<P>
(I went to school in the late 1960s, when the idea of Wall Street's being dull 
was widely accepted. In the recent college classes, where there's wild 
enthusiasm for the $250,000 starting salaries on Wall Street and 75% of the 
students aspire to careers in mergers and acquisitions, perhaps Wall Street has 
become more popular in the writing seminars). 
</P>
<P>
The truth of the matter is that Wall Streeters do, in fact, try as hard as they 
can to appear to be dull. They accomplish this by all wearing the same tan 
Burberries and dark suits, carrying the same burgundy briefcases, behaving 
predictably at public functions, and saying nothing to reporters that is 
remotely odd or controversial. This helps along the impression that they aren't 
really worth writing about, and may have kept the better novelists off their 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
This brings us to "Rascal Money," a new Wall Street novel that if nothing else 
ought to be praised for simply having been written. On the other hand, the 
author, described in the publicity blurb as a "well-respected business 
analyst," must think that Wall Street is pretty boring himself. I'm presuming 
this because of the considerable effort he makes to jazz up his story with 
silly characters, including a mobster named Guiseppe Verrazano (alias Joey the 
Bridge), a Hopi Indian, a demented computer hacker, two bumbling KGB agents, 
several thugs from the Japanese Order of the Chrysanthemum, an advertising 
executive who batters her husbands and leaves them in traction, and a CEO's 
wife who writes pornographic novels on the side. 
</P>
<P>
The basic plot -- small and unprofitable company run by inept manager attempts 
to acquire large and profitable company run by very capable manager -- is 
exactly the kind of thing we've been reading about in the newspaper, but here 
it's lost in gratuitous nonsense. A big crane falls on corporate headquarters, 
the KGB agents try to assassinate the computer hacker, General MacArthur is 
dragged up from the Inchon Landing, a Hollywood producer attempts to seduce 
adoring starlets at lunch, and there are stories within stories from Icelandic 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
Also, we're introduced briefly to a gay Jesuit prom queen; Daphne X, a black 
woman who's against sexism; Rama Krishna Shapiro, a "saffron-robed wellness 
therapist," and a banker named Nick Lee, whose real name turns out to be 
Nicodemus Leibowitz even though his parents are Anglicans. These are only a few 
of the silly characters -- caricatures mostly -- who detract from the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Rascal Money" could have been a satire, except that half the time it's trying 
to be serious, and by then it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
My purpose is not to criticize this uneven first effort, but simply to point 
out that it's one more example of a novel that isn't really about Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, with Boesky in jail and Bilzerian convicted, Milken 
indicted, Warner chasing Time, Time chasing Warner, Warner chasing Paramount, 
Kravis suing Kohlberg (or is it the other way around?), Pickens raiding Japan, 
Japan buying the Rockefellers, and Campeau nearly ruined, who needs Wall Street 
fiction, anyway?

FT  02 APR 94 / As They Say in Europe: Italy, a case of plus ca change?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many must have envied the Italians last weekend. They could choose among any
number of new parties, usually led by totally new politicians. For the first
time in the history of a democracy, voters could go to the polls without
being tempted from the path of reason by the siren call: 'Throw the rascals
out.' The rascals had already been thrown out by the police and the
judiciary.
But this cheery view was mistaken, as Monday's perceptive fantasy in the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung indicated. It highlighted the problems faced
by the typical Italian voter: 'Mr Rossi has nothing to complain about. His
wife had come through her operation satisfactorily, the children bring
average reports home, the textile industry in his central Italian small town
is working well. But this election breaks Mr Rossi's head.'
Too much had changed, little was left over from the old system. New symbols,
new words, new faces. So, even by Sunday night, Rossi had not been able to
make up his mind. When he did, it seems he voted for Silvio Berlusconi's
Forza Italia.
The victory of this grouping and what the press call le tre destre italiani
 -the three Italian right wing parties - led to some complex speculation.
Corriere della Sera decided they each had, more or less, 'ancient and
profound roots but together represent a new phenomenon'. This is part of the
truth.
Berlusconi's policies were described by an Italian professor, writing in Le
Monde, as 'all originating in the Thatcherite pharmacopoeia of Anglo-Saxon
neo-conservatism.' That highlights what was truly a new phenomenon in Italy.
A party had not only put forward a political programme but had actually won
the election, too.
According to the professor, Marcello Da Cecco, Berlusconi's borrowed
programme ends in the 'definitive defeat of the trade unions and the
re-distribution of income in favour of the rich'. But Da Cecco did,
accidentally, explain how an Italian party had been able to succeed when
burdened with a political programme, especially such an appalling one. He
noted that it had 'neither been questioned nor discussed' during the
campaign.
By tradition, politics were never discussed on such occasions. Italian
parties had highly political names - Christian Democrats and so on - but no
content. Only slogans. Berlusconi's party seems to be the opposite: it has
policies, and a football supporters' slogan as its name.
But will Forza Italia, in fact, now try to put its published programme into
practice? The contradictions within the ramshackle electoral coalition which
the party leads have been well documented.
If, however, there should be an Italian government with policies that go
beyond paying off appropriate interest groups and being blown half-heartedly
by any wind that seems to prevail, the possibilities are revolutionary. Will
foreign policy no longer consist solely of trying to find out what
Washington thinks it ought to be? Will Italy's Euro-policies cease to be a
poorly constructed replica of France?
Berlusconi has no love for Brussels, though, and we could see one crucial
element of the 'Thatcherite pharmacopoeia' emerge as the new Italian
government pursues a European policy that is nearer to that of Britain.
Perhaps Italy will no longer be a reliable opponent of anything that smacks
of the free market and liberalisation.
Such a change would vindicate fully the complex game played by the British
government which, this week, ensured an increase in the number of votes
needed to block proposals in the EU's council of ministers.
Still, any kind of political activism will worry Rossi and the millions who
voted for Forza Italia. Italy's post-war success, a real economic miracle,
has been founded on the basis of a government which does nothing and creates
obstacles. As an Italian colleague, an expatriate Rossi, told me: 'The
trouble with policies is that they can go wrong.'
He is comforted that Berlusconi was helped to his present eminence by his
contacts with the former socialist leader, Bettino Craxi, now charged with
corruption. And that he was a member of the powerful P2 Masonic lodge which
seems to have lurked behind some unsavoury milestones of contemporary
Italian history.
So, the answer to the above question might still be a reassuring 'niente'.
Perhaps not that much has changed, even though all the papers write of 'the
Italian revolution'. As Niccolo Machiavelli, the greatest political
commentator of them all, noted: 'People are always taken in by appearances
and the outcome of events.'

<LEADPARA>  Jury selection began today for the trial of a former day care center owner
charged with sexual abuse involving more than 20 children. But parents of
seven other children decided not to have their youngsters take part, the
prosecutor said today.;    Judge Marsh McLelland read all the charges to
prospective jurors in Pitt County Superior Court, taking nearly an hour. The
charges showed that Robert Fulton Kelly Jr. will be prosecuted on charges
relating to 22 of the 29 children named in the original indictment.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  7 CHILDREN WITHDRAW IN CHILD-ABUSE TRIAL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     183 charges stand;    Charges involving the other seven children will be
dropped, District Attorney H.P. Williams said.;    "The state is not
proceeding on the other seven children," he said. "The parents requested it.
Those charges will be dismissed.";    He did not say why the parents did not
want to pursue charges.;    Kelly, 43, owned the defunct Little Rascals Day
Care Center at Edenton, about 150 miles east of Raleigh. Prosecutors have said
the charges against Kelly involve children ages 2 to 7.;    The planned
dropping of some charges will reduce the number of counts pending against him
to 183 from 248.;    Kelly and his wife, Betsy, and five others had been
accused of a combined 429 counts of sexual abuse and conspiracy between June
1986 and April 1989. The other defendants are to be tried separately.;   
Kelly, who has been jailed almost continuously since his arrest in April 1989,
has denied the abuse. Defense lawyers suggest that the charges stem from
hysteria and the suggestibility of children.;    Several motions, including a
request to bar cameras and recorders from the courtroom, remained unresolved
as the selection process opened with the first of 400 potential jurors.;   
"An accusation is not proof. Proof must be by evidence . . . the sworn
testimony of witnesses given at trial in the presence of the accused,"
McLelland reminded the prospective jurors.;    During reading of charges,
Kelly sat impassively. He occasionally put his left forefinger against his
temple.;    A number of unresolved issues were expected to slow the pace of
the trial.;    Prosecutors planned to ask McLelland to close the courtroom
when children testify, William P. Hart, special deputy attorney general
assigned to the case, said Friday.;    Also awaiting McLelland's ruling were a
prosecutor's request that media access be restricted, and questions of whether
defense subpoenas were excessive and whether witnesses should be sequestered.;
   Defense lawyer Mike Spivey said during a hearing in April that the case
centered on hysteria that spread after a child allegedly was slapped at the
center.;    The reliability of child witnesses in a complex sexual-abuse case
probably will be challenged by Kelly's lawyers. Spivey won't discuss
particulars, but affidavits filed by the defense cast doubt on some testimony
by children.;    Children questioned;    The children were questioned by
parents, police, physicians, counselors, social workers and lawyers about the
alleged crimes, court papers said.;    Psychologists said in affidavits that
interrogation and adult influence can result in "reconstruction of a memory
that may be subjectively real but is not accurate."  </TEXT>

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Yun Pyong-son: "The </F>
Traitorous Regime Cannot Last Long"] 
  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique established a new traffic tax under the 
pretext of resolving the traffic issue early this year. Now it 
is once again trying to establish a new agriculture-fishery 
special tax as well as an environment tax. 
  The puppets are raving that new taxes are necessary in order 
to generate the financial resources needed to change the 
structure of agriculture-fishery villages in the wake of market 
opening and in a bid to resolve the issue of polluted tap water 
from polluted rivers. However, this is nothing but sophistry to 
justify maneuvers to create new taxes to exploit the people. 
  As is widely known, broad segments of the South Korean 
populace, including farmers, strongly objected to the rice 
market opening, branding the puppets' maneuvers for rice market 
opening as the act of driving farmers to their death and making 
the South Korean people slaves to foreign provisions. However, 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, ignoring their promises and the 
people's resistance, did not hesitate in opening up the South's 
rice markets in order to ingratiate itself with the U.S. masters. 
  In addition, the South Korean people have long urged the 
puppet authorities to come up with a policy to prevent river 
pollution. The rascals received considerable amounts of money 
from intermediary waste disposal companies to overlook the 
discharge of poisonous industrial wastes into the Naktong River, 
and allowed these companies to build waste disposal plants in 
areas designated as tap water protection sites. As a result, 
ten million residents in the Naktong River area alone are 
suffering from a lack of tap water, which is of utmost 
importance to daily living. 
  South Korea has become the worst traffic hell in the world, 
many residents are suffering from the polluted tap water from 
the seriously polluted environment, and agricultural and fishery 
villages are doomed to ruin because of market opening. This is 
entirely attributed to the policy of Kim Yong-sam's flunkeyist, 
traitorous regime against the nation. Therefore, the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet regime should totally assume responsibility for 
this. 
  Nonetheless, the Kim Yong-sam ring's new taxes and their 
attempt to strengthen exploitation of the people is like the 
saying of the guilty person venting his anger upon others for no 
reason. 
  A South Korean radio reported that if the special tax for 
rural and fishing villages and the environment are added to the 
existing education tax and traffic tax, the people will be 
forced to pay an additional four different taxes this year. The 
radio denounced the authorities' maneuvers to establish new 
taxes, saying that if taxes are created every time issues like 
this come up, no matter how many purposeful taxes are created, 
it will never be enough. 
  The South Korean people have been burdened with various 
kinds 
of heavy taxes. According to the materials released by the 
puppet Finance Ministry, taxes that will be imposed upon the 
South Korean rural and fishery households this year will amount 
to an average of almost 1,350,000 won. Like the gangster-like 
theory that taxes can be squeezed out of people once levied, the 
puppet clique has constantly created new taxes and tried to 
exploit the South Korean people by squeezing every last drop of 
their blood. 
  The puppets' babble about generating so-called financial 
resources is a brazen-faced maneuver. To maintain their own 
conveniences and power, the traitorous groups opened the rice 
markets on which the lives of hundreds of farmers depend, and 
have polluted the tap water of the 10 million residents. What 
on earth can they do for the people? 
  While paying lip service to conducting politics centered on 
the people's livelihood, the Kim Yong-sam ring babbles as though 
it is doing something for the people. In actuality, it only 
thinks of exploiting the people. The Kim Yong-sam puppet's 
regime is an exploitatious, blood-sucking regime which exceeds 
preceding rulers. 
  The rascals can never cover up their traitorous color of 
afflicting misfortunes and sufferings upon the people. As long 
as the Kim Yong-sam ring, which answers people's complaints over 
the rice market opening and the river pollution with strong 
exploitation to maintain power, the South Korean people cannot 
free themselves from the present status or poverty 
  The South Korean people will never forgive the Kim Yong-sam 
traitorous regime's crimes and will deal a hard blow to the 
rascals.

<HEAD>Newsprint Recycling Board Named in Maryland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer appointed a
nine-member board Oct. 10 to oversee Maryland's newspaper recycling
law.
   The law passed this year by the General Assembly requires that
by 1992, 12 percent of newsprint used by Maryland newspapers must
be recycled paper. The quota rises to 40 percent by 1998.
   Fees will be levied against publishers that do not meet the
goals.
   The Newsprint Recycling Board will have authority to waive the
fees for publishers that prove they cannot reach the quota.
   The board is made up of representatives of newspaper publishers,
state agencies, private businesses and environmental groups.

<HEAD>Post, Paper Firm in Venture To Boost Newspaper Recyling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUNDALK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Post and a Baltimore waste
paper processor are planning a newspaper recycling venture.
   The Post and Canusa Corp. hope to open a paper-bundling plant in
Dundalk that could handle up to 6,000 tons of old newspapers a
month.
   A corporation they formed, Capitol Fiber Inc., has submitted the
proposal to Baltimore County. Under a county law the plant must be
approved by county environmental officials.
   The plant would sort and bundle the papers in 2,000 pound bales,
prior to shipment to recycling plants, said Bruce Fleming,
president of Canusa.
   Capitol Fiber's application says it would initially be getting
about 1,800 tons of old newspapers a month picked up from
Washington sidewalks. The company would charge the city $10 a ton
for the paper.
   Fleming said he hoped to strike similar deals with Baltimore and
Baltimore County for their newspaper, once they implement recycling
plans.

   Newspapers in Louisiana will begin
printing on recycled newsprint by 1992, officials of the Louisiana
Press Association said Oct. 9.
   The voluntary plan calls for recycled paper to account for 10
percent of the state's newsprint consumption in 1992, 20 percent by
1995, 30 percent by 1997 and 40 percent by 2000.
   David Manship, associate publisher of the State Times and
Morning Advocate in Baton Rouge, said the program is similar to one
now in place in New York state.
   He said most major producers should be able to supply newsprint
with recyclable fibers by 1992.

   CBS Earnings Down 30 Percent in Third Quarter
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. reported a 30 percent decline in
earnings in the third quarter, citing higher television
expenditures, partly for news coverage of events in the Middle
East.
   The network said Oct. 10 that its after-tax profit fell to $43.5
million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to earnings of
$61.9 million during the same period in 1989. Revenue rose 12
percent to $662 million from $593 million.
   Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president and chief executive, said
increased programming costs contributed to the weak quarter. He
said the televison network spent more money on new program
development, first-run summer programming and the aquisition of
program rights for sporting events.
   The company said revenue growth increased primarily from
broadcasts of major league baseball games.
   ``CBS's earnings rre likely to continue to decline,'' Tisch
said. ``However, CBS has the cash reserves to steer through an
economic downturn, while sustaining our long-term plan to improve
ratings.''
   For the first nine months of the year, CBS earned $266.8 million
on revenue of $2.34 billion. That compared to a net profit of
$236.8 million on revenue of $2.10 billion a year earlier.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS's new late-night ``America Tonight'' news
program was third in late-night ratings its first week and had a
smaller audience than the entertainment shows it replaced.
   The half-hour series co-anchored by Charles Kuralt and Lesley
Stahl averaged a 2.3 rating in the first week of October,
two-tenths of a ratings point less than the preceding week's
entertainment shows.
   ABC's ``Nightline'' was well ahead of ``America Tonight,''
averaging a 4.7 rating, but NBC's ``Tonight'' show was the leader,
at 5.6.

<HEAD>`20-20' Producer Resigns Over Bogus Buckwheat Interview</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A producer responsible for an interview with
a ``Buckwheat'' impostor on ABC's ``20-20'' resigned, the network
said.
   Lynn Murray resigned in a ``mutual decision'' with ABC because
of the Oct. 5 segment, ``Whatever Happened to `Our Gang?',''
spokeswoman Maurie Perl said Oct. 11.
   The news magazine aired an interview with a man who claimed he
played Buckwheat in the ``Our Gang'' comedies of the 1930s and '40s
and was now working as a grocery bagger in Tempe, Ariz.
   William Thomas, who actually portrayed Buckwheat, died in 1980.
   Victor Neufeld, the program's executive producer, decided Murray
did not properly handle research for the segment, Perl said. Murray
had worked with ``20-20'' in several capacities for 10 years, Perl
said.

  [Text] The South Korean puppets committed a grave military 
provocation by illegally infiltrating a combat ship deep into 
our side's territorial waters on the West Sea yesterday [5 
December]. 
  At around 1358 [1058 GMT] yesterday, in broad daylight, the 
South Korean puppets infiltrated three combat ships from 
Taechongdo into our side's territorial waters. The combat ship 
group, which infiltrated deeply into our side's territorial 
waters, undertook a combat formation near Chaejak-ri, 
Ongjin-county, South Hwanghae Province with the purpose of 
realizing a hostile attempt. 
  The Korean People's Army's Navy patrol ships, which were 
thoroughly defending the sea guardpost of our socialist 
fatherland, immediately went to the spot and the sea-based 
cannons [haesangpo] undertook a combat posture to take a 
self-defensive measure. Taken by surprise, the rascals 
hurriedly fled southward. 
  The South Korean puppets' reckless maritime infiltration 
activity is a deliberate and premeditated military provocation 
to aggravate artificially the tension on the Korean peninsula. 
  The South Korean puppets should deeply consider the grave 
consequence of the rascals' military provocation and should not 
act rashly. 
  If the South Korean puppets constantly go down the road of 
confrontation and war in spite of our repeated warning, our 
people and People's Army will impose a thousand-fold stern 
retaliation against the aggressors.

  [Text] According to military sources, on 14 June the South 
Korean puppets committed a provocative act of illegally bringing 
recoilless guns into the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ]. 
  At around 09:15 [00:15 GMT] on 14 June, the puppet army's 
armed rascals brought in, and installed at an encampment, 90-mm 
recoilless guns inside the DMZ 600 meters south of the Military 
Demarcation Line [MDL] Marker No. 0412 in front of Kumsa-ri, 
Chorwon County. They took a firing position at our side, thereby 
gravely threatening the safety of our People's Army soldiers who 
were on routine duty at a guard post. 
  At around 08:40 [23:40 GMT] on the same day, a numerous 
number of the puppet army soldiers equipped with automatic 
weapons were inciting a war atmosphere while touring about this 
area by sneaking into the DMZ area southeast of the MDL Marker 
Nos. 0140 and 0170 in front of (?Mt. Taedok) in Changpung County 
on the western frontline and--prior to this, at around 07:50 
[22:50 GMT]--into the DMZ area south of the MDL Marker No. 0468 
in front of Mabang-ri, Chorwon County on the central front line. 
  This is the South Korean puppets' intentional and 
premeditated maneuverings aimed at artificially aggravating the 
situation inside the DMZ area on the MDL and arousing a 
North-South confrontation. 
  The South Korean puppets should profoundly consider the 
grave 
consequences the rascals will cause by their reckless 
provocative acts and should not do rash and thoughtless acts.

<TEXT>     But lawyers for Kelly told the jury of seven men and five women that those
same children had told stories of being put in bags and being hung from trees,
being locked in refrigerators, babies being killed, burned and buried -- none
of which figures in any of the charges.;   Likewise, said Michael Spivey, a
lawyer for Kelly, at various points the children have accused nearly a dozen
other adults whom officials have never charged.;   "The longer it went on, the
wilder the stories got," Spivey said. "Every effort was focused on trying to
prove that these things happened, not at getting at the truth. They created a
belief in something that never happened.";   Spivey said the motive for all of
this was revenge sought by a family who believed that Kelly had unfairly
disciplined their child. With the urging of these parents, a rumor mill among
Edenton's 6,000 residents went to work and took "a nasty turn," he said.;   On
Monday, only one witness took the stand in the case of the 43-year-old Kelly,
who is accused of 187 counts of sexually abusing 22 children at the day care
center. Kelly is the first of seven defendants in the case growing out of
allegations first made in 1989.;   Also charged are his wife, Betsy Kelly; the
operator of Edenton's video rental and shoe repair shop, and four other adults
who worked at the day care center.;   The trial, which some court officials
predict could take four to six months, is being held here, 60 miles west of
Edenton, to avoid the taint of pretrial publicity that might have made it
impossible to pick an unbiased jury.  </TEXT>

NO SURPRISES IN VOTING: INCUMBENTS WIN EASILY

A national push to "throw the rascals out" didn't materialize in Southeast-area 
congressional races this year. 
</P>
<P>
Seven incumbents, some of them fending off spirited attacks by challengers, won 
reelection by solid margins in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a conservative Long Beach Republican, won handily 
despite being stung in recent weeks by allegations that he used drugs as a 
youth and by the defeat in Congress of his proposal to withhold federal funding 
for art he considers obscene. Rohrabacher defeated political science instructor 
Guy Kimbrough in District 42, which stretches from Huntington Beach to 
Torrance. Rohrabacher also defeated Kimbrough two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a very outspoken congressman," Rohrabacher said. "If I can do that 
and still have a solid victory, it's a signal from the voters to our elected 
leaders that they should come out with strong stands." 
</P>
<P>
Four Democratic incumbents and two other Republican lawmakers easily prevailed 
in Southeast-area congressional races over an array of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The only non-incumbent elected was Maxine Waters, a veteran Democratic 
assemblywoman who recorded a lopsided victory in District 29 to succeed the 
retiring Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles). Hawkins has occupied the 
seat in the heavily Democratic district since 1962. The district covers 
South-Central Los Angeles, South Gate, Huntington Park and part of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's race against Democratic challenger Kimbrough heated up following 
the allegations of drug use, which first appeared in an article in New Republic 
magazine. But on Tuesday the congressman said the drug issue wasn't a factor 
because "it was so long ago." 
</P>
<P>
He called the controversial debate over funding for the National Endowment for 
the Arts a "wash" in the election. "It alienated some wealthy Republicans who 
go to the symphony," Rohrabacher said, "but it gave me support from some of the 
blue-collar Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
In his second term in Congress, he said, he plans to concentrate on expanding 
the opportunities for employee ownership of companies in the United States and 
developing a plane that will take off from a runway and fly into space. 
</P>
<P>
"Whichever nation controls that technology will dominate the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) also rolled up a solid victory, 
despite being accused by his challenger of being a once-vigorous legislator who 
no longer had the energy to do the job after serving 11 terms. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a little tougher election, especially for incumbents," said Anderson, 
77, whose victory margin was a bit smaller than two years ago. "Normally when 
we have elections we don't have several hundred thousand troops someplace where 
there might be a war. People are unhappy about that and there was lots of press 
about throwing the rascals out." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who defeated Republican Sanford Kahn, said he didn't believe voters 
were swayed by the attack on the veteran lawmaker's ability to do the job. "I 
feel I'm much better now than I was 10 years ago," Anderson said. "I know more 
about the problems." 
</P>
<P>
District 32 covers San Pedro, Harbor City, Wilmington, Lakewood and parts of 
Long Beach and Downey. 
</P>
<P>
At a victory celebration at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, Waters, 52, told 
a crowd of about 300 cheering supporters that she was going to Congress to 
continue fighting for the poor and disadvantaged as she had done during her 14 
years in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to do what I've always done," she said. "I'm going to be a voice for 
the people who sent me." 
</P>
<P>
One of her first priorities, she said, will be passing a civil rights measure. 
President Bush recently vetoed the Civil Rights Acts of 1990 and the move to 
override his veto failed by one vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to talk with all of (the congressmen) and let them know that we're not 
going away on this issue of civil rights," Waters said. "I'm going to fight and 
fight and fight to ensure that we pass a civil rights bill." 
</P>
<P>
Waters' Republican opponent, Bill DeWitt, a former South Gate councilman, said 
he had no illusions about winning in a district where Democrats outnumber 
Republicans 7 to 1. "I went into it with my eyes open," he said. "I knew the 
demographics and statistics. I ran because there was an opening and no 
Republican had filed. I had fun." 
</P>
<P>
Other Democratic winners included Matthew G. Martinez of Monterey Park, who 
defeated businessman Reuben D. Franco in District 30; Mervyn M. Dymally of 
Compton, who won handily over former Long Beach councilwoman Eunice N. Sato in 
District 31, and Esteban E. Torres of La Puente, who easily fended off a 
challenge by John Eastman, an official with a Newport Beach land investment 
company. 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, David Dreier of La Verne defeated Georgia Houston Webb, 
a college admissions official, in District 33, and in District 38, Republican 
Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove outdistanced Barbara Jackson, public affairs 
director for Planned Parenthood in Santa Ana. Though her name remained on the 
ballot, Jackson had dropped out of the race early and did not campaign.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Chong Pong-kil: "Not </F>
Separation But Collusion"] 
  [Text] Broadcast reports from Seoul disclosed the fact 
that Yi Pyong-tae, the recently appointed puppet defense 
minister, was a member of the Hanahoe. 
  The Hanahoe, a political military club at the center of 
criticism from every strata of South Korea, was a powerful group 
of fascist military hooligans basically composed of former 
members of the Chilsonghoe. The Chilsonghoe had consisted of 
seven generals--namely Chon Tu-hwan, No Tae-u, Son Yong-kil, 
Chong Ho-yong, Kwon Ik-hyon, Choe Sung-tae, and Paek 
Un-taek--who hailed from Kyongsang Province and graduated in the 
11th class of the South Korean Military Academy. 
  While under the patronage of traitor Pak Chong-hui following 
the 16 May Coup, they changed the name of Chilsonghoe to the 
Hanahoe when they were pinned with the insignia of major on 
their shoulders. Being on the lookout to seize power, they 
increased membership to approximately 200. 
  Following this, the rascals expanded their area of influence 
to include all graduates between the 11th to 36th graduating 
class of the South Korean Military Academy. Chon Tu-hwan, No 
Tae-u, Chong Ho-yong, and Pak Chun-pyong, the chief culprits 
behind the 12 December coup and the Kwangju massacre, were 
Hanahoe members. Chang Se-tong, Ho Sam-su, and Ho Hwa-pyong, 
the henchmen to traitor Chon Tu-hwan in the Fifth Republic, were 
nests of the Hanahoe. 
  The fact that Yi Pyong-tae, who has assumed the position of 
puppet defense minister, was a member of the notorious secret 
military group shocks the South Korean people. 
  The appointment of Yi Pyong-tae a member of the secret group 
of vicious military gangsters as puppet defense minister by 
puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam all but shows his intention to 
revive the Fifth and Sixth Republics's influence and repeat the 
fascist suppressive rule of the Fifth and Sixth Republics in 
South Korea. 
  As everyone knows, the Kim Yong-sam group has prattled as 
though the Hanahoe had been broken up and took measures as 
though to remove Hanahoe members not only from the puppet 
regime, but also from the military when Traitor Kim Yong-sam 
raved that he would wipe out the Hanahoe members from the 
civilian regime, and the puppet Army announced that 10 colonels 
who were Hanahoe members would be excluded from promotions. 
  However, this was a trick to deceive the South Korean 
people. 
The chieftain of the civilian regime has not separated itself 
from the Fifth and Sixth Republics but are colluding with them. 
  With the people's spirit of resistance growing higher due to 
the rice market opening, traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to 
appease the people's protests by means of shifting the blame 
onto his stooges and firing them, while naming vicious military 
gangsters to important posts. 
  These facts show that the Kim Yong-sam group has not 
eliminated the Fifth and Sixth Republics's forces and prove, 
even worse, that it drew the rascals into its civilian regime in 
order to resurrect the Fifth and Sixth Republics' military 
fascist terrorist rule. 
  In reality, the Kim Yong-sam group is carrying out fascist 
suppressive rule over the South Korean people more than ever 
before. On 28 December, traitor Kim Yong-sam, during his visit 
to the Seoul District Prosecution Office to check 
end-of-the-year readiness, made outbursts that he would not 
tolerate violent demonstrations. Even before taking office, the 
puppet interior minister, raved that it is okay for the 
investigators to torture political criminals. 
  By following the puppet traitor's suppressive order, South 
Korea is dripping with a warlike atmosphere and the people's 
righteous struggle for independence, democracy, and 
reunification are now being brutally oppressed. 
  Needless to say, the worsening fascist suppressive maneuvers 
of the Kim Yong-sam group are aimed at suppressing and 
obliterating the people's struggle to oppose the rice market 
opening. 
  Attempting to defuse his regime's crisis, puppet traitor Kim 
Yong-sam named the Hanahoe group's military gangsters and 
fascist oppressors whom the South Korean people criticize in 
order to oppress and obliterate the people's antigovernment 
struggle. Nonetheless, this is nothing but a last-ditch 
resistance by one who faces a tragic end. The fascist 
suppression will only heighten the resistance of the people and 
hasten the self destruction.

NEW POSTAL COMPLEX IN SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A. WILL GIVE ECONOMIC BOOST TO AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Koiu Chang Lee can remember when the view from the doorway of his grocery in 
South-Central Los Angeles was not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
Directly across the street from the neighborhood store on South Central Avenue 
near Gage Avenue was the hulking shell of a long-vacant tire plant surrounded 
by weeds that grew as tall as a man. On rainy days, the unpaved walk around the 
plant oozed brown mud into the street. On dry days, the weeds became a trash 
receptacle for passers-by. Lee's customers were mostly neighborhood people 
because passing motorists didn't often stop along a business strip where most 
of the storefronts were boarded up. He was making an adequate income for 
himself and his family, he said, but just barely. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lee stood in the front of his store and looked out at a different 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Where the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. plant once stood is a newly constructed 
Main Post Office and General Mail Facility for Los Angeles, a sprawling complex 
of modern, low-slung gray and green buildings with landscaped grounds that 
after next Saturday will be the center of postal operations for the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Force of 5,500 
</P>
<P>
The complex, which will have a work force of 5,500, is expected to boost the 
economy in the neighborhood five miles south of downtown, not by bringing new 
jobs to people in the neighborhood, but by bringing in people who have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the positions at the complex will be filled by workers who now 
work downtown at the outdated Terminal Annex mail processing operation near 
Union Station. Other jobs will be filled through the Postal Service's regular 
Civil Service procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The post office will remain open at Terminal Annex, but the buildings where 
mail is processed will be sold or leased once the city Community Redevelopment 
Agency comes up with a master plan for the area around Union Station, postal 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Those expected to benefit most from the huge transfer of personnel from 
downtown to South-Central are people like Lee, owners of small businesses who 
hope postal workers will cash their checks, eat meals and buy merchandise near 
where they work. 
</P>
<P>
Already, in mere anticipation of the opening of the postal complex, a 
restaurant has opened across the street, two others are planned and established 
businesses are expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is having a portion of his store remodeled into Main Post Office Check 
Cashing, a walk-up check-cashing stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides the environmental effect, I don't know what benefit (the postal 
complex) will bring to me," he said, "but I'm going to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Buster Williams, 30, one of the owners of the Lil Rascals Cafe directly across 
from the postal complex's employee parking lot, said he and his brother, Merk, 
had the postal workers in mind last year when they bought three badly 
deteriorated storefronts for $60,000 and had them combined. Their restaurant 
opened in December. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope for New Clientele 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not depending totally on the post office people," Buster Williams said, 
"but I am hoping they will be a large part of our clientele." 
</P>
<P>
The Williams brothers, both truck drivers, grew up not far from the old tire 
plant and still live there. They have not been in business before and probably 
wouldn't be now, said Buster Williams, if it were not for the new postal 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood around the complex is a mixture of residences and industrial 
sites. Between it and downtown are trucking firms and fresh fruit and flower 
distribution markets. The neighborhood is generally poor and parts of it are 
run-down. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of some of the tiny bungalows just east of the complex said they 
welcome any new businesses near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Goodyear closed the whole strip has been dead," said Vernell Holloway, a 
young mother who lives on 68th Street. "You had to walk a pretty good ways to 
find a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Projects 
</P>
<P>
Now the strip is reviving. Besides Lee's addition to his store and the opening 
of Lil Rascals, these enterprises were under way within two blocks of 
Holloway's home: 
</P>
<P>
* Louis Hale is planning to expand his check-cashing operation for what he 
expects to be a 300% increase in business. Hale said he bought the property for 
$44,000 four years ago, and recently was offered $200,000 for it. 
</P>
<P>
* Owners of the Fat &amp; Fat Market are renovating a storefront that will 
become the Fat &amp; Fat Chinese Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
* The owner of the building that once housed the United Rubber Workers union is 
having the structure demolished to make way for a mini-mall that is already 80% 
leased. A single unleased unit, said the man's real estate broker, is being 
sought by a major hamburger chain.

Charles W. King, general manager and postmaster for the Los Angeles division of 
the U.S. Postal Service, said no one is happier than he about the optimism 
among the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
King called the postal complex "the most major development in South-Central 
since the Watts riot." 
</P>
<P>
The $151.6-million complex is on 74 acres of land bounded by South Central 
Avenue on the east, railway lines and an industrial park on McKinley Avenue on 
the west, Florence Avenue on the south and Gage Avenue on the north. It is 
dedicated to the late Leslie Nelson Shaw Sr., who was postmaster for Los 
Angeles from 1963 to 1969 and the first black to head the post office of a 
major American city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Complex 
</P>
<P>
The six buildings constructed since 1985 include a neighborhood post office, a 
three-story administrative building, a warehouse, a garage, a maintenance 
support building, and a state-of-the-art mail processing plant the size of 10 
football fields. 
</P>
<P>
The processing plant will handle 6.7 million pieces of mail daily and is 
equipped to accommodate increases in the city's mail flow for the next 20 
years, postal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
South-Central residents will receive no preferential treatment for the jobs at 
the complex, but they won't have to travel as far to apply for work. The 
personnel office that hires for all of the Postal Service's operations in Los 
Angeles has been moved to the South-Central complex. 
</P>
<P>
King, who along with other administrators moved his office from downtown to the 
new complex months ago, said he has heard nothing "adverse" from people who 
live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"They recognize that there will be new investment" in the neighborhood, he 
said. "The reaction to that has been very favorable."

  [Text] According to a report by the Christian Broadcasting 
System from Seoul, the rascal called puppet Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae made a report before the puppet National Assembly 
Defense Committee on 23 March. In his report to the committee, 
he raved about someone's nonexistent provocation, babbled that 
strong retaliatory actions would be taken, and that he has 
mapped out a strategy to link this with reunification if 
necessary. 
  This is a clear incitement to achieve reunification through 
a 
northward invasion which by no accounts can ever be ignored. 
  The warmonger's blurting out about retaliatory actions 
directly means a war. In addition, his remark that this would 
be used as the opportunity to realize reunification means that 
South Korea will achieve reunification through a northward 
invasion by borrowing power from the United States. Rascal Yi 
Pyong-tae frankly admitted this time that it is mapping a 
strategy to realize the goal of invasion. 
  This clearly shows what stage the adventurous war 
provocative 
maneuvers waged against us by the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group 
have reached. 
  On 22 February, traitorous Kim Yong-sam called puppet 
military chieftains to Chongwadae [the presidential office] to 
plot a war and ordered the entire puppet Armed Forces to assume 
an emergency alert posture. Following this, the puppet defense 
minister emerged at the National Assembly and made an outburst 
agitating a northward invasion. These facts cannot on any 
account be incidental. 
  All of these facts show that the Kim Yong-sam clique, under 
the aegis of the U.S. imperialists, are captured with its 
ambition to achieve reunification by invading and thus 
prevailing over the North. In addition, these clearly expose 
the fact that its maneuvers of heightening the tension that they 
have perpetrated up to now by finding faults with our 
nonexistent nuclear issue, are a premeditated provocation to 
open the road for northward invasion.

FT  27 MAY 94 / Throw the rascals out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world will probably seem pretty gloomy to the government a fortnight
from now. Pause a moment, while we rub our hands in glee. The big day is
Friday June 10. The Tories expect to wake up on that morning to news of the
loss of their formerly safe seat of Eastleigh to the Liberal Democrats.
Better yet, they may find that their candidate, their sacrificial lamb, has
been beaten into third place behind Labour. The weekend papers will be full
of talk about alternative leaders of the Labour party, perhaps spiced by
musings on the future of the prime minister.
The results of the elections to the European Parliament will follow. We will
see the great match taking shape: a revived opposition vs a flagging
government. It may become harder than ever to believe that the Conservatives
can recover sufficient support to win a fifth general election, even in the
nearly three years still available to them.
Good. They deserve to be thrashed. I say this in the electoral rather than
the Singaporean sense, you understand. Those of us who doubt the efficacy of
corporal punishment should not change our principles, not even in the case
of Mr John Patten, the education secretary. Mr Patten's sense of honour may
be measured by his retailing earlier this week of what he said was said to
him in a private conversation in a railway carriage. So much for the
gentleman who preaches to the nation's children about moral standards. This
is the kind of thing that gives hypocrisy a bad name.
It is not, however, a reason for encouraging the Conservatives to leave
office. If the bad manners of one particular minister were the problem, the
solution would be simple. The case for throwing all the rascals out is more
complicated. To appreciate it, step back a bit. After 1979 the gov-ernment
of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher undid much of the damage wrought by the
Labour administration that preceded it. She vanquished the trade unions,
initiated the rolling pri-vatisation of industry, and taught us that simple
book-keeping is a necessary skill in all walks of life and all institutions.
Her successor has curbed inflation, maintained Britain's position at the
Maastricht negotiations on the European Union, and established rapport with
Dublin on the future of Northern Ire-land. These achievements, among others,
deserve recognition. The balance of advantage, however, has turned.
Today the prime minister is struggling to manage an unruly coalition of what
should be separate parties. The government is unable to do very much, beyond
blather. It promises a green paper on this and lists existing policies in a
white paper on that. Here a charter, there an inquiry, everywhere a working
party. It is a ministry of paper initiatives, a taxpayer-financed agency for
self-advertisement. Civil servants are unwilling to propose very much, and
determined not to write down what they do discuss. The urge to further
radicalism may be genuine, but the performance is disappointing.
If that were all, there would be little cause for complaint. The government
could be said to be in a state of do-nothing equilibrium, a minimalist's
ideal. Sadly, that is not all. 'Do-nothing' is often a harmful choice.
Do-something can be worse. Local government has been hobbled. The behaviour
of parliamentarians has brought political life into disrepute. Ministers
spend too much of their time dishing out money and jobs to favoured
individuals, companies or organisations. Fifteen years of continuous office
has resulted in the creation of a patronage state, as described in a report*
published on Monday by a pair of pressure groups, Charter 88 and Democratic
Audit.
The report suggests that there is now one executive quango for every 10,000
population, and that these bodies are responsible for nearly a third of
public spending. It may be right, if not precisely so. Let us halve the
authors' figures to eliminate any chance of exaggeration. The picture that
remains is startling. Britain is replete with opportunities for patronage,
secretive deal-making and good old fashioned corruption. We do not need a
democratic audit to prove this. Just observe. There stands the health
secretary, arms outstretched, guarding every health service trust from
public scrutiny, arousing suspicion by the zealousness with which she
defends the secrets of these spenders of our money.
The Conservatives have torn the heart out of the unwritten British
constitution. The democratic checks on executive power have been replaced in
the name of customer choice. What the latter phrase often means is
placemen's self-preservation. The irony is that the latest evidence of this
comes in a week when all three national parties have published manifestos
for the elections to the European Parliament. Labour and the Liberal
Democrats balance their views on possible reforms of EU institutions with
programmes for the restoration of civic life in Britain. Both summarise
their proposals for domestic constitutional reform in their Europe
manifestos.
Not the Tories. They will have none of it. They talk as if subsidiarity
stops at Calais. They cannot win elections to town halls, so they emasculate
local authorities. They are rejected by the Scots, but will not look at
Scottish self-government. 'A separate Scotland would be relegated to the
lower divisions of Europe,' says their manifesto.
This refusal to contemplate any improvement in our constitutional
arrangements applies to all areas of public life. They shy away from reform
of the House of Lords, although individual Tory peers are more sensible than
that. Simple improvements to House of Commons procedure make little headway.
Several suggestions of reform of the way bills are prepared have been made;
none accepted. The consequence is that more legislation is made in
amendments than in initial bills.
Conservatives need to think these matters through. They have run the country
as if they were in office forever. They govern by ever-increasing
centripetal force. Finding out what an unscrupulous administration of a
different political colour could do with the powers ministers have
accumulated for themselves would teach them a lesson, at our expense. We
must hope that Labour, which is still an unappetising alternative, makes
itself electable before we have to choose.

<LEADPARA>  Prosecutors dropped more charges Monday in Farmville, N.C., against a man
accused of abusing children at the day-care center he once operated, and his
lawyers argued that all charges should be dropped. Six charges were eliminated
during morning arguments before Superior Court Judge D. Marsh McLelland,
leaving Robert Kelly Jr. facing 122 charges involving 13 children. Kelly is
accused of abusing children at his Little Rascals day-care center in Edenton,
120 miles east of Raleigh. Kelly's lawyers filed motions to have all the
remaining charges dismissed. McLelland made no ruling Monday.;   Arizona Gov.
J. Fife Symington was named as a defendant in a $140 million government
lawsuit filed Monday in Phoenix, becoming the first major elected official to
be sued for his alleged role in the collapse of a savings and loan. Symington,
a Republican elected in a close race in February, branded the federal action
"outrageous," telling reporters in Arizona that it is "typical of Washington
run amok." The long-anticipated suit, filed in U.S. District Court by the
government's Resolution Trust Corp., alleged that Symington and 11 other
Southwest Savings and Loan Association directors were negligent and failed to
live up to their fiduciary duties.  </LEADPARA>

FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Strong Frontera sales behind IBC Vehicles'
return to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBC VEHICLES, the UK-based 60/40 joint venture between General Motors and
Isuzu, staged a strong recovery in 1992 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.2m
against losses of Pounds 28m in the previous year.
The company, formed in the late 1980s from the former loss-making Bedford
van operations in Luton, more than tripled turnover to Pounds 426m, compared
with Pounds 133.7m.
Production was more than doubled to 48,452 (20,932) vehicles as a result of
the successful build-up of output of the Opel/Vauxhall Frontera four wheel
drive leisure utility vehicle.
The ranges produced by IBC are based on Japanese technology from Isuzu and
Suzuki. GM holds minority equity stakes in both companies.
GM has, however, decided to halt production of the Suzuki-derived range of
microvans at IBC from the end of June following a collapse in demand.
Production of the small vans has plunged from 21,500 in 1989 to 5,652 last
year, and output has been cut to only 1,790 in the first half of this year.
Vauxhall sales of the Rascal van in the UK dropped last year to only 2,478
from 8,274 in 1990.
The market for Japanese-designed microvans has shrunk dramatically, and GM
is hoping that it can meet residual demand through the forthcoming launch of
its new Corsa high-roof van.
As the Rascal is withdrawn other competition is coming into the market,
however, with the launch by Daihatsu of its Italian-built Hijet microvan,
which is being assembled at a joint venture plant at Pontedera, Tuscany with
Piaggio of Italy.
GM is planning to keep the Midi panel van in production at IBC at least
until 1995-96, but it is in negotiations with other vanmakers in Europe
about collaboration on a new vehicle range to replace the ageing Midi in the
second half of the 1990s.
The future of the IBC operation is now tied closely to the production of
four wheel drive leisure utility vehicles; output of the Frontera is planned
to increase from 31,436 last year to 42-45,000 in 1993.
The company has reached agreement with trade unions for the introduction of
a third shift at the plant, if this can be justified by higher demand for
the four wheel drive vehicles, which have succeeded so far in defying the
steep fall in demand for new cars in western Europe.

FT  16 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Losing wagers litter path to final
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betting-wise, the World Cup has not proved my finest hour, writes Michael
Thompson-Noel. No bookmakers have topped themselves as a result of my bets,
which is always the bonus I savour most.
I got over-heated to start with; then slowed to a crawl; and was finally
flattened by queasiness at the sight of Brazil's shrinking odds. In short:
bad strategy, poor money management, and loss of nerve.
I started too excitedly, backing Colombia and Argentina, then Romania,
Nigeria and Germany, and eventually Bulgaria - six squads of shirt-lifters.
Between them, these australopithecines cost me Pounds 308 (including tax).
The only sensible bet I made all month was Pounds 60 Brazil to win the World
Cup at 3-1, which was the best price you could find in London on June 17.
Italy were 6-1 that day, but I have never backed Italy in my life. On the
other hand, the bookies were offering half-odds if teams reached the final,
so there must be thousands of Italians already showing a huge collective
profit.
This is what attracted me to Romania at 33-1 after they trounced Colombia.
Romania - I divined - were a team from the 21st century; pity about their
penalty-taking.
As the tournament progressed and Brazil looked far from convincing, I stared
in horror at their rapidly-shrinking price. This was my big mistake.
There is a streak of showiness in my character which at times mutates into a
bulging vein of vulgarity. Among other things, this makes me a
contra-bettor. I disdain sensibly-priced favourites such as Brazil and
instead bet on flashy outsiders such as Nigeria, Romania and Bulgaria.
As things stand, I will lose Pounds 134 even if Brazil win tomorrow. So
yesterday I rang the wretched bookies, looking for an escape.
I started with the rascals at Ladbroke, which calls itself, smugly, the
biggest bookmaker in the solar system. Brazil, said Ladbroke, are now 8-15
to win the cup, and Italy 11-8. This is no help to me. I never bet odds-on.
So I questioned the rascals severely. I asked them what the odds were
against Brazil beating Italy 4-1, as they did in the World Cup final in
1970. Answer: 40-1. Brazil to win by 10 goals to nil? Answer: 100-1.
These odds are inhumanly cramped. I would rather buy blood from a vampire.
But I believe I have no choice. With a mighty smirk and swagger, I will
today bet Pounds 20 on a 4-1 Brazilian win and Pounds 20 on a 10-0 pasting.
I mean, Italy?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "The National Security Law </F>
Must Be Abolished"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported, on 3 March, U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher acknowledged that a U.S. 
official's recent remarks which demanded that the National 
Security Law [NSL] of South Korea be abolished were not an 
individual's private opinion, but the official position of the 
United States. The final acknowledgment made by the U.S. 
secretary of state on the United States' official position 
towards this law came out because the South Korean puppets were 
clamoring that U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
Hubbard's remarks calling for the abolition of the NSL in his 
speech at American University on 25 February were merely an 
individual's opinion. This proceeded from the present U.S. 
administration's acknowledgment that one of the reasons for the 
failure in progress in dialogue and negotiation between the 
North and the South of Korea lies in South Korea's NSL, and this 
is, albeit belated, very fortunate. 
  As everyone is well aware, the NSL of South Korea is a 
product and legacy of the military dictatorship and a most 
vicious, evil, fascist law blocking free dialogue and exchange 
between the North and the South by describing us as an antistate 
organization and as an enemy. Under the patronage of the United 
States, the successive military dictatorial regimes of South 
Korea used the NSL and various anticommunist fascist evil laws 
to brutally suppress the South Korean people's struggle for 
independence, democracy, reunification, incite North-South 
confrontation, and block the country's reunification. Following 
the fifth and sixth republics, the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime 
has also been mercilessly suppressing not only the South Korean 
people's struggle for independence, democracy, and 
reunification, but also young students and people who called for 
holding dialogue with us, thus blocking the road to dialogue. 
  Last year alone, the Kim Yong-sam fascist ring suppressed 
and 
blocked all patriotic struggles of the South Korean students and 
people for national reconciliation, unity, and reunification 
such as the North-South students' talks that were slated to be 
held in Panmunjom on 12 June, the fourth pannational rally in 
Seoul, the Pyongyang-Seoul university students' soccer games, 
and the North- South student bicycle race. The rascals went so 
far as to block our proposals to pay respects before the coffin 
of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan in Seoul and to hold a working-level contact 
in Panmunjom between North-South Chondoist representatives in 
order to discuss holding joint North-South celebrations for the 
centennial of the Kap-o peasants' war. 
  The truculent, fascist tyranny of the Kim Yong-sam ring 
which 
blocked fellow countrymen from expressing condolences and even 
trampled upon the patriotic and nation-loving will of 
North-South Chondoists using the NSL evokes strong opposition 
and rejection by the world's people. The indiscreet 
infringement upon human rights and the antireunification and 
antidialogue maneuvers perpetrated indiscreetly by the Kim 
Yong-sam ring under the mask of being a so- called civilian-led 
government have been so unscrupulous that even high-ranking U.S. 
officials were moved to call for the abolishment of the NSL. 
  One of the reasons why the Kim Yong-sam regime has been 
branded as a civilian-led fascist regime is because it retains 
the NSL. It is precisely because of the NSL that various 
channels of dialogue and exchange between the North and the 
South in the past have failed to make any progress and that 
numerous South Korean people who had advocated the country's 
reunification and who had visited the North were imprisoned. 
  This notwithstanding, the Kim Yong-sam ring has not only 
been 
brutally suppressing the South Korean people's just struggle for 
independence, democracy, and reunification with the NSL, but is 
also clamoring that it is impossible to abolish the NSL and the 
like today, at a time when the issue of abolishing the law has 
become an issue. The Kim Yong-sam ring's opposition to the 
abolition of the NSL proceeds from its wicked intention to 
suppress the South Korean people's just struggle with the law 
and to block the country's peace and its peaceful reunification. 
It also more clearly reveals that the rascals' clamor about a 
civilian-led government and the like is an out-and-out lie and 
that the rascals are fascist tyrants and national traitors who 
are dashing toward fascism, division, and confrontation. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to maintain the dirty 
remainder of its life on a road of fascism and confrontation. 
This, however, is a gross miscalculation. The road of fascist 
suppression and confrontation will further incite the popular 
masses' resistance and will only expedite the Kim Yong-sam 
ring's ruin. The Kim Yong-sam ring should look straight at the 
trend of the times and abolish, without delay, the NSL, an 
antireunification and fascist evil law.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The Shameless Behavior of </F>
Splittists"] 
  [Text] The South Korean puppets are further revealing 
their splittist nature. On 6 May traitor Kim Yong-sam appeared 
in the site celebrating the so-called workers' day. At the 
site, babbling that we are continuing instigation activities 
toward the South without renouncing a nuclear development 
program and that we are pointing long-range missiles at the 
South he clamored that the South Korean people should renounce a 
dreamy view on reunification. 
  On 7 May Yi Hong-ku, minister of the puppet unification 
board, held a so-called unification and security policy 
coordination meeting. At the meeting he clamored that it will 
be inevitable for the UN Security Council to impose sanctions in 
case we refuse to accept additional inspections, that stern 
countermeasures should be taken, that an international alliance 
system will be further strengthened, and the like. He also 
urged us to observe the Armistice Agreement, like a thief 
turning on their owner, and expressed the will to oppose a new 
system for guaranteeing peace that we have proposed recently. 
  These shameless remarks by traitor Kim Yong-sam and rascal 
Yi 
Hong-ku which reverse black and white are none other than the 
splittists' sophistry which makes the world's people laugh. 
Traitor Kim Yong-sam clamored that our missiles are aiming at 
them. He carries his distortion of facts too far. Who aims at 
whom? 
  Everyone knows that over 1,000 nuclear weapons deployed in 
South Korea today are aimed at our Republic on a continuous 
basis. Patriot missiles and Apache attack helicopters which were 
introduced from the United States recently are now deployed in 
the central frontline sector near the Military Demarcation Line. 
At the same time with the deployment of these weapons, U.S. 
Defense Secretary Perry came to South Korea and returned home 
after reaffirming on the spot the preparedness for attack by 
U.S. forces and the South Korean puppet army. 
  Such being the situation, traitor Kim Yong-sam's behavior is 
too shameless. What we cannot but see more seriously is that he 
urged the South Korean people to renounce their view on 
reunification, babbling that it is a dreamy one. This shows 
that traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks that he would make every 
effort to achieve national reconciliation and reunification and 
to build a peaceful, reunified fatherland by uniting the divided 
fatherland into one are an out- and-out lie. This also shows 
that he is not interested in the country's reunification at all. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a more vicious splittist and 
flunkeyist nation-seller than successive military fascist 
dictators. 
  Next, as soon as he assumed the post of the puppet 
unification board, the rascal Yi Hong-ku held a so-called 
unification and security policy coordination meeting. At the 
meeting he clamored about sanctions against us at the UN 
Security Council, the international alliance system, and the 
like. Although he is the minister of the board, he completely 
revealed that he is a national traitor and splittist who, 
regarding the nation as an enemy, is driving the country into 
permanent division. 
  As was already reported on 3 May, answering questions raised 
by reporters, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that proceeding 
from our consistent position to show the irreproachability 
[kyolbaeksong] of our nuclear activities under the special 
position in which we have temporarily suspended the taking 
effect of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, we have not only decided to conduct the replacement of 
fuel rods this time thoroughly under the surveillance of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], but also immediately 
issued entry visas for the five inspection members suggested by 
the agency. At the same time, we have made clear that all fuel 
rods replaced will be placed under the control of the IAEA and 
that measuring them will be permitted at a time when the nuclear 
issue is settled in a package deal at DPRK- U.S. talks in the 
future. 
  This is an expression of our Republic's greatest generosity 
and sincerity. This is why the broad social opinion of the 
world positively appraises this proposal of ours and why it is 
urging the United States not to cling to pressure but to 
sincerely come to the table of the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  This notwithstanding, Yi Hong-ku is still taking a hostile 
attitude toward us by clamoring about sanctions, the cooperation 
system, and the like. This is indeed an antinational and 
antireunification crime. 
  With regard to Yi Hong-ku's remarks that urged us to observe 
the Armistice Agreement while opposing our peace-guaranteeing 
proposal, it is not us but the United States and the South 
Korean puppets who has violated the Armistice Agreement. The 
peace in Korea has been in danger because the United States has 
been reinforcing its force of arms in South Korea for more than 
40 years since the Armistice Agreement was signed, and because 
the South Korean puppets are perpetrating the new war 
provocation maneuvers together with the United States. 
  Meanwhile, the present armistice mechanism can play no role 
in preventing a new war on the Korean peninsula at all. This is 
why we have put forward a proposal for a new system of 
guaranteeing peace. Nevertheless, opposing this proposal, the 
puppets are calling for us to observe the Armistice Agreement. 
This is indeed a reversed logic. 
  All facts mentioned above reveal once again that the South 
Korean authorities are vicious splittists and bellicose elements 
seeking only confrontation and war. These rascals will receive 
due stern judgment from our people without fail.
