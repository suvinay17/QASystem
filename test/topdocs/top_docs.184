   Presidents Jose Sarney of Brazil and
Victor Paz Estenssoro of Bolivia signed accords Tuesday to share
intelligence information in anti-drug efforts and to trade natural
gas and petroleum byproducts.
   Sarney, on a three-day visit to South America's poorest country,
called the agreements ``historic ... not only for Bolivia but for
all of South America.''
   ``The agreements call for sharing intelligence information on
drug trafficking activities between Brazil and Bolivia, the
training of personnel to combat the drug trade'' and increased
anti-drug border controls, Sarney told a news conference after the
signings.
   Under the agreements, Bolivia will sell 3 million cubic meters
of natural gas to Brazil daily for 25 years. Sales are to begin in
1992, when Bolivia's contract to sell natural gas to Argentina
expires.
   Conditions for the sale would be agreed upon within 180 days,
Bolivia's Foreign Ministry said. Natural gas provides $350 million
of Bolivia's annual $470 million in export earnings, the Central
Bank said.
   Brazil also agreed to help Bolivia build a fertilizer and
hydroelectric plant near the Brazil-Bolivia border and assured
Bolivia a market for agricultural and petroleum byproducts for 25
years.
   The two neighbors also agreed to build roads and railroads that
would increase commercial links. One railroad under consideration
would connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

  [Text] Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) --
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, speaking about
Latin American integration today, said: "We have failed and we
must recognize it in our lack of political willingness to
eliminate borders because they exist more in the minds of our
countries' leaders than in geography."
  Sanchez de Lozada spoke before his Argentine, Brazilian,
Paraguayan, and Uruguayan counterparts to thank them for the
invitation to participate as an observer in the fifth Mercosur
[Common Market of the South] summit. The Bolivian president
said: "Our peoples have always considered themselves brothers
and members of a greater Latin American family. In this process
of advancing behind an ideal, we have fallen and risen many
times, but we are learning."
  "The new international reality has a dizzying dynamism. The
EC is practically a reality. There are new and powerful
economies in Asia and the Chinese giant seems to be awakening,"
Sanchez de Lozada said.
  "With our past experiences and the demands of the world
today
we, Latin Americans, are taking the challenge of integration
more seriously, and Mercosur is proof of that," Sanchez added.
  "We, Bolivians, are convinced that undertakings such as
Mercosur, the Andean Pact, or the Group of Three have the common
objective of advancing behind a larger and broader sub-regional
integration ideal, which will be followed by a regional and then
a continental integration process," the Bolivian president said.
  "We congratulate ourselves for the implementation of NAFTA
not only because it represents an important step forward in the
economic relations of friendly countries, but also because
Mexico's participation establishes new and promising terms for
our intercontinental economic and trade relations."
  Sanchez stressed: "We must direct all our integration energy
toward convergence and direct all our bilateral and subregional
efforts toward a regional economic area."
  The Bolivian president said this integration must be based
on
three basic pillars: free trade with productive investment,
international equality, and social well-being "because the
economy must serve man and not simply the statistics."
  Sanchez de Lozada said: "Bolivia has a role in this process
of articulation and contact. We are ready to play our role in
American integration. We have a deep belief in integration and
we will play our role in the River Plate area, or the Andean,
Amazon, Pacific, or Atlantic regions."
  Sanchez de Lozada concluded by saying: "Bolivia is a
privileged country in the Latin American region because of its
geographical position, its clarity, the continuity of its
economic policy, and, above all, because of its unfailing
integrative political will."

  [Text] La Paz, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The Bolivian Foreign Ministry
confirmed today that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada and Chilean President Eduardo Frei will meet within the
framework of the Fourth Ibero-American summit to be held in
Cartagena, Colombia.
  The Bolivian Foreign Ministry reported that the two heads of
state, who will attend the Fourth Ibero-American summit on 14
and 15 June, will take the opportunity to hold an informal
meeting.
  This will be the second time Sanchez de Lozada and Frei have
met since August 1993; the other time was during Sanchez de
Lozada's inauguration.
  The Bolivian president took advantage of another
international meeting, the Rio Group meeting in Santiago, to
meet with Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and then Chilean
President-elect Eduardo Frei.
  Bolivia and Chile have had no diplomatic ties since 1962 --
except for a brief three-year period (1975-78) -- as a result of
a territorial dispute and Bolivia's demand for a sovereign sea
outlet to the Pacific across land that has belonged to Chile
since the 19th century.
  The Bolivian Congress authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel
to Colombia to attend the Ibero-American summit which will be
attended by the heads of state from Latin America, Spain, and
Portugal. The summit will be held in Cartagena on 14 and 15
June.
  Congress also authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel to the
United States, where he will attend the opening game of the
World Soccer Cup at Soldier Field in Chicago; Bolivia will play
Germany on 17 June.

  [Text] Colonia de Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay today
agreed to integrate Bolivia as an observer country in all the
meetings of the work subgroups of the Common Market of the South
(Mercosur).
  The decision was made during the fifth Mercosur summit,
which
ended in the city of Colonia, after a formal petition made by
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.
  Presidents Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of
Brazil, Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, and Luis Alberto
Lacalle of Uruguay issued a public declaration expressing their
satisfaction with the Bolivian Government's desire to extend and
strengthen its ties with Mercosur.
  The declaration states: "They thus considered it appropriate
to respond to Bolivia's petition by inviting its representatives
to participate, as observers, in the meetings of the work
subgroups."
  The presidents also state that "within the framework of
Bolivia's petition, agreements with Bolivia will be prioritized
with the perspective of its future total participation in
Mercosur."
  President Sanchez de Losada attended the summit as an
observer and in his speech he stressed his country's interest in
Mercosur without forgetting other integration agreements Bolivia
has signed.
  Technically, Bolivia cannot join Mercosur because it already
belongs to the Andean Pact, but it can associate with it through
a free market system.
  The Bolivian president said before his colleagues that "we
must recognize that we have failed" in Latin American
integration "given the lack of political will to eliminate
borders that are presently more in the minds of our countries'
leaders than in geography."
  Sanchez de Losada added: "Our peoples have always considered
themselves brothers and sisters within a great Latin American
family. In this process of attaining an ideal, we have fallen
and risen many times, but we are learning."
  "With past experience and the demands of our current times,
we Latin Americans are taking more seriously the challenge of
integration, and Mercosur is proof of this," he added.
  "We Bolivians are convinced that efforts like Mercosur, the
Andean Pact, and the Group of Three have the common objective of
making progress toward a greater and broader integration," he
stated.
  Sanchez de Losada concluded by saying: "Bolivia plays a role
in this process by being a point in common and a contact among
regional groups. We are willing to play the role that
corresponds to us given our continental vocation, our deep
integrationist will, and our presence in the River Plate,
Andean, Amazon, Pacific, and Atlantic areas."

  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma this
afternoon disclosed Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada's official response to the invitation conveyed to him by
Chilean President Patricio Aylwin to attend the Chilean
presidential inauguration.
  Sanchez de Lozada says that it is not still advisable for a
Bolivian president to attend an official ceremony. He added
that his wife Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada will
represent him.
  Silva Cimma read to the press Sanchez de Lozada's reply:
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] He says that for reasons that
are not beyond President Aylwin's illustrious acknowledgement, a
visit by a Bolivian president to Chile to attend an official
ceremony is not yet advisable. He has, however, empowered his
wife, Mrs. Ximena Iturralde de Sanchez de Lozada, to represent
him as a proof of his consideration and personal esteem toward
their excellencies President Aylwin and President Frei Ruiz
Tagle. [end recording]
  Sanchez de Lozada also conveyed thanks for the invitation
conveyed to him by his Chilean counterpart Patricio Aylwin, and
wished the best success to future President Eduardo Frei
Ruiz-Tagle.
  Silva Cimma said it is not suitable to speculate on this
response which, according to him, does not affect bilateral
relations.
  [Begin Silva Cimma recording] I hope this letter will not
lead to speculations, considering that the reply to the
invitation was made in a very delicate way and in terms that I
think are self- explanatory. Therefore, I am simply announcing
the official report, and that is it. [end recording]
  Diplomatic relations between Chile and Bolivia were
disrupted
after the Pacific War of the last century, when Bolivia lost its
outlet to the Pacific Ocean.

  [Excerpts] The Chilean Government has indicated that it is
fully prepared to begin a "new era" of relations with Bolivia by
evaluating positively Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada's most recent remarks about not tying any future step
toward the resumption of diplomatic relations to the beginning
of talks on Bolivia's lack of a sea outlet.
  It has been explained, however, that the positive reaction
of
the Chilean Government does not imply that diplomatic relations
will be resumed immediately.
  Chilean politicians stated that Sanchez de Lozada's
statement
was "very positive" and praised the president's modern and
daring approach.
  Both government and political circles, however, agree that
the remarks of the Bolivian president should be taken prudently
bearing in mind that there are people in Bolivia whose position
toward Chile and what they call "Bolivia's landlocked situation"
is very hard and inflexible. [passage omitted]
  Foreign Relations Under Secretary Rodrigo Diaz Albonico
said:
"We were very happy to hear what Bolivian President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada had to say."
  Jorge Pizarro, speaker for the foreign relations committee
of
the Chamber of Deputies, believes that Sanchez de Lozada's
remarks "are extraordinarily positive and reflect that the
Bolivian president has a modern and daring approach to what
relations between the states should be as far as the process of
integration is concerned, in order to further the social and
economic development of our peoples."
  Experts in Bolivian-Chilean relations believe that rather
than a change in Bolivia's foreign policy, there is a new and
promising approach, confirmed by the fact the Sanchez de Lozada
attended the Rio Group presidential summit in Santiago last year.
  "After what Sanchez de Lozada said, it is assumed that this
so-called `new approach' will lead Bolivia to begin talks aimed
at reestablishing diplomatic relations in the not too distant
future," the experts said.
  Despite the remarks of the Bolivian president, the sources
are not sure whether Bolivia's strategy is to resume relations
and immediately tackle the sea outlet issue or to deal with both
issues simultaneously.
  Chile does not acknowledge any pending issues between the
two
countries on the grounds that there are treaties in effect,
especially the 1904 treaty, which establish the current border
between the two countries. Thus, Chile did not accept any
conditions when the resumption of ties was proposed in the past.
  The Foreign Ministry under secretary pointed out that the
Bolivian president used the expression "new era" which is the
same one Diaz Albonico used when he went to La Paz last year.
The under secretary said that this was highly significant.
  As to Bolivia's new willingness to approach the resumption
of
diplomatic ties without first tackling its so-called "landlocked
situation," Albonico said that Sanchez de Lozada's words should
be studied carefully.
  He added, however, that the remarks of the Bolivian
president
augur a change in the political relations between the two
countries, that may free them from past problems.

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 27 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian President
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has stated that Bolivia is running the
risk of becoming the target of "narcoguerrilla" actions. In a
statement published by the La Paz newspaper ULTIMA HORA today,
Sanchez de Lozada explained that in Chapare, a region in the
central part of Cochabamba Department, "the atmosphere is ripe
for the establishment of drug cartels or the operations of
narco-guerrilla groups." [passage omitted]
  Sanchez de Lozada stated that "all coca leaves produced" in
the Chapare region are used to manufacture cocaine, not for the
traditional and legal uses of this leaf. [passage omitted]
  Sanchez de Lozada also announced that his administration
wants to draft a new drug enforcement policy in coordination
with the United States Government.
  "This is very important for them (the North Americans),
because even though they have acknowledged after many years that
the responsibility for this situation should be shared, we must
come up with a proposal capable of truly resolving this
problem," the Bolivian president said.
  Sanchez de Lozada agreed that drug trafficking is one of
Bolivia's most serious problems, and stressed that it
jeopardizes Bolivia's relations with the rest of the world.

  [Text] Rocio Bernal, chief editor of Channel 7, has
prepared an important report summarizing the main aspects of the
meeting between Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and
Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem in Buenos Aires:
  [Begin Bernal recording] I have important news from
Argentina. An important energy agreement was signed by President
Sanchez de Lozada and Argentine President Carlos Menem. The main
aspects of the agreement are the sale of 6.1 million cubic
meters of natural gas per year at an initial price of $1.21 per
cubic meters until 1996. As of 1996, the price will be increased
annually based on international prices. For the first time
Bolivia will sell gasoline to Argentina. This will allow Bolivia
to obtain an income of $4 million a year. Regarding light crude
oils, the cubic meter will be sold to Argentina at $162.50
delivered at the Palmasola plant.
  The official Bolivian mission that went to Argentina headed
by President Sanchez de Lozada also was able to obtain an
investment of $5 million for the next two years as of the
agreement's signing. An investment of $15 million for the next
four years also was obtained. The contract signed with Argentine
Government Oil Deposits is an important step for the country's
benefit, and from the quality and quantity viewpoint it is
better than the previous contract. President Sanchez de Lozada
expressed by phone his complete satisfaction with the result of
his visit to Argentina because the No. 1 issue, the sale of
natural gas to Argentina, was excellent for Bolivia after
difficult negotiations.
  Also, the presidents of Argentina and Bolivia reviewed
international, regional, and bilateral issues within the
framework of cordiality and friendship. They pointed out the
excellent level of relations between the two governments, and
verified the importance of the issues discussed during the
recent visit of the Argentine foreign minister to Bolivia
included in the La Paz Joint Declaration on 22 December 1993.
  With the purpose of pointing out the positive results of the
current visit, the presidents signed a joint declaration that
says they reaffirmed their commitment to contribute to the
consolidation of democracy in the continent as the essential
basis for keeping peace and developing social justice to protect
human rights and implement economic development.
  The two presidents agreed that the invitation made by the
four Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries to Bolivia
to have government representatives participate as observers in
the meetings of subgroups will contribute to strengthening the
mechanisms of appropriate relations for joining the Mercosur
integration process.
  Regarding the Bolivian maritime claim, which is one of the
main components of Bolivian foreign policy, the Bolivian
president expressed his satisfaction over the possibilities now
existing for sincere dialogue among all the parties involved.
  The two presidents also expressed their conviction that the
14th meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee of the
Paraguay-Parana Waterway to be held in Formosa [Argentina] from
21 to 25 March will strengthen cooperation between the states on
the waterway program and will be progress in studying the
related issues that will facilitate regional integration.
  Within the framework of economic cooperation between the two
governments, the Argentine Government gave Bolivia the
equivalent of $84 million, of which $54 million is for local
projects and will be disbursed from April to December. The
remaining $30 million will be used to finance Argentine and
Bolivian goods, installations, and equipment for a broad health
program in the border regions of Argentina and Bolivia. To this
effect, the two countries' health officials will prepare the
adequate projects of basic infrastructure and health. Within 60
days, a trade agreement will be signed establishing free
transit, without tariffs or other types of fees, on goods
between the two countries. This is for the competitive
fabrication in Bolivia of products for the Argentine and
Bolivian markets, for exporting to third countries, and for
offering incentives for the investment of Argentine and Bolivian
capital to this effect. The two presidents expressed their
satisfaction with the signing of the agreement on reciprocal
promotion and protection of investments.
  Upon concluding his state visit, constitutional Bolivian
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada thanked Argentine President
Carlos Saul Menem for his expressions of sympathy and friendship
and for the warm hospitality of the Argentine Government and
people. [end recording]

  [Text] In a joint declaration Paraguayan President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada
last night described the Pilcomayo River and the areas around it
as a decisive factor in promoting integration among Argentina,
Bolivia, and Paraguay, and decided to invite Argentine President
Carlos Saul Menem to a meeting with a view to seeking formulas
that would be instrumental in jointly undertaking mutually
beneficial development projects.
  Paraguay and Bolivia also stated that they are committed to
fighting the drug trade, and agreed to hold permanent
consultations between senior officers of their two countries.
The Paraguayan Government supports "the search for a negotiated
agreement" to provide Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific
Ocean. Sanchez de Lozada has characterized this goal as "an
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people."
  In the joint declaration, which was signed at Lopez Palace,
Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada attached special significance to
the Pilcomayo River, but did not go into detail. They agreed,
however, to invite President Menem to a joint meeting to
undertake joint projects. They have not set any specific date
for this meeting. They have also acknowledged that the abuse of
and illegal trade in narcotics and dangerous substances are a
serious threat to the health and well-being of all peoples, and
noted that all nations must assume their share of responsibility
in fighting this scourge at every level and in all of its forms.
They reiterated their commitment to fighting the drug trade,
and agreed to urgently implement bilateral actions.
  To strengthen friendly relations and cooperation between
their two countries, they have decided -- based on a proposal
from the Bolivian Government -- to hold consultations between
senior officers of their respective Armed Forces, through
periodic meetings to be held at least once a year, alternating
in Bolivia and Paraguay.
  Regarding the gas pipeline, Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada
emphasized the work of the energy technical commission that is
studying the sale to Paraguay of Bolivian natural gas through
the gas pipeline project, of liquefied gas, and of gasoline.
They conveyed their desire to have the project implemented as
soon as possible with the participation of the private sectors
of both countries.
  They also expressed their satisfaction over the progress and
consolidation of the democratic system both in the world and
within the region. They regard this as a guarantee for the full
exercise of human rights and a necessary condition for achieving
socioeconomic development.
  They also mentioned the efforts made to find formulas that
would enable Bolivia to gradually move closer to and join
Mercosur [Common Market of the South].
  They agreed on the need to strengthen the Agreement on
Coordination and Cooperation among Bolivia, Paraguay, and
Uruguay (Urupabol), which was reactivated on 16 October 1993,
and emphasized the consultations taking place among the three
countries with a view to holding, as soon as possible, a meeting
of their three foreign ministers.
  Among other points, President Wasmosy informed his Bolivian
counterpart that the Paraguayan Government is studying a project
to build a dam in Bahia Negra to check the Paraguay River water
flow. He noted that this project will generate a development
process in vast areas in the region, will make the river
navigable along its entire course, and will decrease ecological
risks.
  They also stated that it would be useful to improve customs
monitoring at their common border. A customs office will be set
up in General Garay. Sanchez de Lozada stated that the goal of
obtaining a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean is a
fundamental topic in Bolivian foreign policy, and "an
unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." Wasmosy voiced
his government's unwavering support in the search for a
negotiated agreement on this issue.

  [Text] La Paz, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada today announced that 1994 will be the year of
great structural changes, when the traditional "come back
tomorrow" of public administration will become a thing of the
past.
  Sanchez de Lozada today, Thursday, met with the local press
at a rural spa in Cochabamba, where he is resting for a few days
to "recharge his batteries" before facing the challenge of the
change beginning with the preparation of the nation's general
budget.
  The president explained that the budget proposal he will
send
to congress will be accompanied by several draft laws "which
will give meaning to the budget" and which will implement the
structural changes.
  "The first drafts show that more than half of the budget
will
be earmarked for the social area," Sanchez de Lozada said,
because "great structural changes must be made to cover the
growing social needs, to serve as the basis of the coming year:
capitalization, educational reform, law against corruption,
people's participation, and simplification of bureaucracy."
  The 63-year-old Bolivian president said that for 1994 there
will be an increase [in salaries] of 7.5 percent in order to
maintain the purchasing power of the salary and that will be
equal to the inflation rate calculated for this year.
  "If we begin with greater increases, we will have higher
inflation, greater deficit, and a lower level of economic
growth," Sanchez de Lozada said, and asked whether it was worth
having considerable increases, which would later be overcome by
the increases in prices.
  He ruled out the reported increase in fuel prices which
prompted the increase in prices and hoarding of other products,
and added that he will adopt other measures to improve income,
such as reducing the tax rates and increasing the tax base.
  Sanchez de Lozada said that a system to simplify state
administration transactions will be implemented next year, thus
seeking "to eliminate the torment the citizens" must go through
when they are involved in these transactions and to eliminate
from public offices the "come back tomorrow."
  He ruled out any change in his cabinet. "It was so difficult
for me to organize it," he said. He added that if it does not
yield the expected results in the future, there might be some
changes.
  He compared the structure of the Council of Ministers he
inherited from the previous government with a "Model-T Ford with
which we could not win a formula one race." He added: "I built a
race car that could not start because it was not well tuned."
  Sanchez de Lozada was optimistic over the state of his "race
car" although he admitted that "if we begin to run strong and if
some part breaks down we will have to fix it quickly" to meet
the expectations of the Bolivians who want to see the government
working.
  The Bolivian president will return from Cochabamba, 383
kilometers east of La Paz, next week.

and his Bolivian counterpart, Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada, today
analyzed, among other subjects, the probable granting of
Argentine credits for environmental sanitary projects on the
common border area between the two countries for the purpose of
preventing the spread of cholera, the situation of illegal
Bolivian immigrants in Argentina, the struggle against drug

  Sanchez de Losada today arrived in Argentina on an official
48-hour visit with the objective of signing an agreement on
plant and animal sanitary controls and an agreement on
investment promotion and guarantees.
  President Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella received
the Bolivian president at 1020 today in Metropolitan Airport's
military section.
  After the welcoming protocol, City Council President Juan

state the keys to the city.
  During a brief news conference after the ceremony, Sanchez
de
Losada said one of the subjects he would discuss with Menem is
the situation of some of his fellow countrymen living illegally
in Argentina.
  He added: "The control of drug trafficking is very
important,
and with the aid of Argentina and the international community we
will be able to stop this problem."
  As for the possibility that Bolivia will join Mercosur, the
Bolivian president said: "We want to come close to Mercosur
because we are part of the Amazon Basin," adding that "our
future depends on exchange with the region's countries."
  After making these statements, Sanchez de Losada departed
for
Alvear Palace Hotel, from where he headed to Casa Rosada, where
he held his first working meeting with Menem.
  After the meeting in Government House, the two presidents
went to San Martin Palace, where Menem held a lunch in honor of
his guest.
  The Bolivian president had anticipated that during his visit
to Argentina he would talk with President Menem about subjects
like illegal immigrants, Mercosur, cholera, and the canalization
of the Pilcomayo River.
  Sanchez de Losada said Argentina is, for Bolivians, "almost
a
second fatherland; one is always very connected with this
country and thousands of Bolivians currently live in Buenos
Aires," which determines "a relation of vital importance for us."
  When asked whether the subject of illegal Bolivian
immigrants
will be discussed, he said "that will be one of the subjects we
will discuss" and added that they will also discuss the
canalization of the Pilcomayo River, which is "one of Bolivia's
major concerns."
  "The Pilcomayo River is dwindling away and it is important
for Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina," he said.
  Regarding drug trafficking control, Sanchez de Losada said:
"It is a very important subject, and we will speak about the
Bolivian criteria to ask Argentina and the international
community for help to put an end to this phenomenon, which is
something we cannot stop."
  He added that the future of Bolivia "depends a lot on what
is
going on in Argentina, on the possibility of increasing
exchange, and on a rapprochement" between the two countries.

  [Text] La Paz, 20 Mar (EFE) -- Government sources told EFE
that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will reshuffle
his cabinet in the next few days.
  A majority of La Paz newspapers said in their front pages on
20 March that Sanchez de Lozada will reshuffle his cabinet,
dismissing some of his ministers and changing the assignment of
others, possibly on 22 March.
  The sources consulted by EFE said the ministers who will
almost surely leave the government are Defense Minister Antonio
Cespedes, Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters, and Interior Minister
German Quiroga.
  The same sources said the "super ministers" of economic
development, Fernando Illanes, and human development, Fernando
Romero, will have their assignments changed.
  The sources also said that current Minister of the
Presidency
Carlos Sanchez Berzain and an outstanding entrepreneur and
political leader from Santa Cruz are the leading candidates to
replace Interior Minister Quiroga if he leaves the cabinet.
  Sanchez de Lozada's government is formed by a coalition of
his party, the liberal Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR),
the populist Civic Solidarity Union (UCS), and the social
democratic Free Bolivia Movement (MBL).
  The UCS, the party granting the MNR control of the absolute
majority in Congress, presently has one of its members as head
of the Defense Ministry. The post was assigned to Antonio
Cespedes, but he is expected to leave the government because his
own party has requested that he be removed.
  The MBL, whose votes in Congress are not essential, was able
to get the Foreign Ministry for its leader Antonio Aranibar. His
continuation is assured because he seems to be Sanchez de
Lozada's government's most popular minister.
  Sanchez de Lozada formed his government on 6 August 1993
after his victory by a relative majority in the 6 June 1993
election.
  In these seven months of government, Sanchez de Lozada's
cabinet has established the legislative basis for a future
absolute transformation of the Bolivian economy and
administration.
  The key instruments in this transformation are the
Capitalization Law to privatize public companies, and the
People's Participation Law to give more power to citizens in the
political and administrative decisionmaking process and the
allotment of state resources through the country's
municipalization.
  Sanchez de Lozada also has reorganized the executive branch
by significantly reducing, among other things, the number of
ministries.

  [Text] Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada on 16
March ratified in Buenos Aires his country's desire to join the
Common Market of the South [Mercosur], which includes Argentina,
Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. The Bolivian president is here
on an official visit, and during his first meeting with Carlos
Menem he discussed the signing of several bilateral agreements.
He also began discussions to obtain a measure of exception that
will allow Bolivians who reside here to obtain their residence
documents.
  "For Bolivians, Argentina is practically their second
fatherland. Thousands of Bolivians reside in Buenos Aires and
throughout Argentina and contribute toward this country with
their work," Sanchez de Losada said on his arrival in the
country.
  Regarding the possibility of joining Mercosur, the Bolivian
president said: "I have very much wanted to approach Mercosur
because we are a part of the Pacific's Amazon Basin, but we also
belong to the River Plate Basin." But a diplomatic source
indicated that the possibility is very remote and could only
happen within the framework of a Brazilian initiative to create
a giant South American common market.
  Moreover, the agenda's main topic is the signing of an
agreement that will permit the free exchange of gas, oil, and
their by-products with an eye on bilateral integration in the
energy sector. Argentine credits for the prevention of cholera
in border areas is also an agenda topic.

  [Text] The meeting that had been scheduled for 20 March in
Formosa, Argentina, among Paraguayan President Juan Carlos
Wasmosy, Argentine President Carlos Menem, and Bolivian
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has been postponed. The
decision was prompted by the fact that Sanchez de Lozada could
not attend the meeting, because he is scheduled to meet in La
Paz with U.S. Vice President Al Gore on that day.
  The three presidents had been scheduled to meet on 20 March
to discuss the Pilcomayo River issue. Yet the above problem has
forced a postponement of the "minisummit" to a later date.
  During Sanchez de Lozada's recent visit to Asuncion,
Bolivian
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga noted that the Formosa
presidential summit might be postponed. It was confirmed
yesterday at Lopez Palace that the meeting has in fact been
postponed.

  [Text] La Paz, 22 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The metaphor about
the "milk and the cow" was thoroughly explained today by
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, when he said that even if
Bolivia gets a sovereign sea outlet -- it wants to take concrete
steps on the sea issue with Chile -- it must also get several
outlets on both the Pacific and Atlantic, with the full use of
the port of Ilo in Peru as well as the Paraguay-Parana waterway
and other ports in Argentina and Uruguay.
  "Even though the sea outlet claim is a valid issue, though
problematic and difficult, we want to make progress in all
fields -- cultural, political, and economic -- in all fields
related to our great effort to have a sea outlet on the Pacific
and outlets through the waterway," said President Sanchez at a
news conference held today to talk about the positive aspects of
his tour of the United States and Colombia.
  The controversial statement made by President Sanchez de
Lozada after meeting with Chilean President Eduardo Frei
prompted a wave of protests for an allegedly antipatriotic
policy on the sea outlet issue.
  This policy was denied today by President Sanchez de Lozada,
who said that the talk with President Frei was from any point of
view very positive, because the sea outlet issue will be debated
during the Rio Group summit next September.
  "We want to see concrete things, concrete steps to improve
the Bolivian situation," said Sanchez de Lozada, who pointed out
the work being carried out by Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori, whom, he said, was carrying out "concrete" work
allowing greater binational contacts, one proof of which is the
highway linking the port of Ilo with the Bolivian border.
  The explanation given by President Sanchez de Lozada on the
metaphor he used after meeting with President Frei was mainly
related to the fact that Bolivia has to use other "outlets" to
the Pacific and Atlantic, and these would be the port of Ilo in
Peru and the Paraguay-Parana waterway, because Bolivia is
entering a stage of economic and productive expansion for which
it is necessary to seek ports for exports.
  Sanchez de Lozada said: "Even if Bolivia gets a sovereign
sea outlet -- and this is our great goal and struggle, which
will not change in this government or in any other -- we must
also find other ports that will not be Bolivian, but Chilean,
Peruvian, and on the waterway of the River Plate Basin. In its
projection abroad Bolivia must show that by negotiating with our
neighbors we can get benefits without having direct ownership of
those ports and their installations."
  In this regard, President Sanchez de Lozada said there is a
feeling of solidarity in the neighboring countries (Peru,
Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay) which makes him believe that
Chile will also enter a new stage of relations for mutual
benefit.
  Therefore, said Sanchez de Lozada, it is hoped that for the
September meeting the Bolivian and Chilean Foreign Ministries
will prepare a work agenda that will consider the issues
dividing the two countries under a new spirit of friendly
relations.

  [Text] Let us now report on President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada's participation in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit.
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada held a working breakfast meeting with Chilean
President Eduardo Frei this morning. The two presidents
discussed such issues as exports and the Bolivian claim to the
sea coast.
  [Sanchez] We discussed it, we looked at it, and we said that
this is a current problem. How can we solve it? The solution
has not... [Sanchez recording ends abruptly]
  [Reporter] The foreign media asked President Sanchez if a
sea
outlet was the only way for Bolivia to integrate itself into a
modern economy.
  [Sanchez] The sea outlet is the only way, but this is not
necessarily related to... [Sanchez recording ends abruptly]
  [Reporter] In addition to the issue of the sea outlet, other
important issues for the two countries were also discussed.
  [Frei] Issues such as economic complementation, physical
integration, seeking common positions on matters of education,
and joint binational projects such as natural gas, which is an
important energy issue for Bolivia.
  [Reporter] How would you label this meeting?
  [Frei] Positive and very cordial.
  [Reporter] The result of the working breakfast meeting
between the two presidents was the preparation of an agenda for
the two foreign ministries. [end recording]
  The meeting was positive and cordial, an important meeting.
There are differences, and we are under the impression that
President Frei recognizes them despite the Chilean official
position that Chile has nothing pending with Bolivia. There is
a long way to go, but this process, which we believe is
loosening up, is a good one, without illusions but with clear
ideas. Let us now listen to Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at the
Ibero-American Summit:
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Are there plans for a new
meeting between the Bolivian and Chilean presidents next
September?
  [Sanchez] Yes, that is true, and a request was made to the
foreign ministries to prepare an agenda for the different
committees to start working, looking at the problems. The sea
issue was raised, but we did not make any progress on that
point. We want to make progress on all issues, including the
sea issue.
  [Reporter] What about natural gas?
  [Sanchez] The natural gas issue was also definitely raised,
and there seems to be a very good predisposition and some
contacts with Chilean state companies. This kind of negotiation
seems to be the best way for people who are used to working on
projects, and not to getting involved in diplomatic subtleties.
  [Reporter] Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada labeled the Fourth
Ibero-American Summit positive. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] After arriving in our country to settle the
details, Bolivian Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Gumucio announced
that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will make an
official visit to Peru. According to the Bolivian official, the
Bolivian president will arrive in Lima on 5 July. Diplomatic
sources indicated that Sanchez de Lozada's visit will be an
opportunity to promote mutual cooperation and integration.
  The confirmation of such an important visit was made by the
Bolivian vice foreign minister at a time when there is a lot of
interest in Peru to increase trade ties that began with the
installation of an industrial free zone in the port of Ilo.
  The Foreign Ministry has also reported that President
Alberto
Fujimori has officially invited Colombian President Cesar
Gaviria to visit the country. In a letter he sent to Gaviria,
Fujimori highlights the close ties that unite the two nations.
The invitation was made as a result of the visit Fujimori made
to Bogota in February. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada arrived on
15 January in Laguna de los Patos Airport in the Uruguayan city
of Colonia. There he was met by the Colonia mayor and then
talked to the press.
  [Begin recording] [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we hope for
informal and frank bilateral approaches and approaches with
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. We hope we will be able
to approach this market that is so important for Bolivia and
that will become more important in the future.
  [Unidentified reporter] The Uruguayan press announced during
the past few hours that Presidents Lacalle, Menem, and Wasmosy
[of Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, respectively] reportedly
have virtually accepted Chile's and Bolivia's entry in the near
future.
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we have some problems because
we are still part of the Andean market. We do not want to quit
this pact. Nevertheless, we would like to become a hinge and
actually be received by this agreement. If there is such a
political will, it would be something good, but we will wait for
this to become official. If it becomes official, we will
consider it with much interest. [passage omitted] [end

  [Text] Sucre, Bolivia, 26 May (EFE) -- Bolivian President
Sanchez de Lozada announced today his intention of establishing
a Constitutional Court to restructure the judiciary.
  After meeting with Supreme Court members in Sucre, the
country's administrative capital, Sanchez de Lozada announced
that he will promote the establishment of a Constitutional Court
during the extraordinary congressional sessions that started
last week, and during which the constitution will be amended.
  After meeting with Sanchez de Lozada, acting Chief Justice
Gualberto Davalos expressed the Supreme Court's opposition to
the establishment of a Constitutional Court.
  Davalos explained that the Bolivian Supreme Court has and
will always oppose the establishment of a Constitutional Court,
because it believes it would undermine the Supreme Court's
powers and the autonomy of the judiciary.
  Sanchez de Lozada expressed his determination to propose the
establishment of a Constitutional Court in the constitutional
amendments, and cited several European and Latin American
countries that have one.
  The Bolivian Supreme Court has been virtually paralyzed
since
last year in view of impeachment proceedings undertaken against
its president, Edgar Oblitas, who has been charged with
extortion.

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 26 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Bolivian President
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada swore in his new cabinet today,
thereby ending the ministerial crisis plaguing the first eight
months of his administration. This will allow Congress to
approve several projects presented by the Executive Branch.
  The president told the new members of his cabinet: "The
stage
for creativity has ended. Now another stage can begin; one of
practical and specific actions."
  Sanchez de Lozada made changes in his 10-member cabinet
after
five ministers resigned. He also created a minister at large,
thereby putting an end to what he believes is the first stage of
his administration, which was inaugurated on 6 August 1993.
  The Bolivian leader affirmed that this change was necessary
because it comes at a vital and significant time for the
country. Sanchez de Lozada is trying to get Congress to approve
several draft laws regarding capitalization, popular
participation, and education reform. [passage omitted]
  Leaders of the four political parties that comprise the
ruling coalition were present at the ceremony. They said the
new cabinet will carry out the changes and programs set forth
over the past seven months.
  Max Fernandez, a leader of the Solidarity Civic Unity, who
is said to be responsible for the cabinet crisis, said, "the
time has come for the president to receive the conditional
support of the ruling coalition to demonstrate that changes have
finally come for the Bolivian people." Fernandez demanded a
greater say within the Executive Branch in exchange for votes to
approve the laws Sanchez de Lozada has presented to Congress.

  [Text] La Paz, 9 Jun (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada today announced that Marcelo Cespedes
Gutierrez has been appointed the new labor minister. Gutierrez
replaces Reynaldo Peters, who resigned today.
  Peters' sudden resignation can be added to those of Luis
Lema, Bolivian ambassador to Argentina; and Jorge Otasevich, the
congressional and political affairs under secretary, both of
whom resigned today.
  Ernesto Machicao, minister of social communications,
explained that the resigning government officials will replace
those senators who have been objected to in the ongoing
impeachment process against the suspended president and senior
justice of the Supreme Court.
  The impeachment process against Supreme Court President
Edgar
Oblitas and Senior Justice Ernesto Poppe is in its final stages
after an anguishing process in the Chamber of Deputies and the
Senate. This is the first effort made to establish a precedent
in the battle against corruption undertaken by the Sanchez de
Lozada administration.
  The defense objected to several of the senators from the
ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR). In view of
this there was a risk that the two-thirds of the votes necessary
to approve the impeachment would not be achieved.
  With the votes of Peters, Lema, and Otasevich, the MNR will
be able to secure the majority of votes necessary to approve the
impeachment process.

  [Text] La Paz, 12 May (EFE) -- The government coalition in
Bolivia is facing the immediate threat of losing one of its
allies and being left without an absolute majority in Congress.
  Max Fernandez, leader of the populist Solidarity Civic Union
(UCS), whose deputies guarantee the government's absolute
majority in Congress, harshly criticized President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada after threatening to withdraw his support.
  So far the special session of Congress called for 9 May by
Sanchez de Lozada has not been held, because the UCS, in a
demonstration of force, has joined the opposition in boycotting
the president's call.
  Sanchez de Lozada "is worse than a dictator" said Max
Fernandez, according to his remarks published by LA RAZON today.
  The president "has no reason to tweak my ears, because I am
not anybody's boy. I am a businessman and a person who deserves
respect," said Fernandez, who is the majority owner of the
National Brewery, one of the largest companies in the country.
  Max Fernandez announced he will meet with Sanchez de Lozada
in the next few days, assuring that "by God, it will be the last
and definitive meeting between the president and myself."
  Sanchez de Lozada, heading the Nationalist Revolutionary
Movement (MNR), won by a simple majority the 6 June 1993
elections.
  Thanks to a pact with the UCS, Sanchez de Lozada was elected
president by Congress and was able to form a government
coalition supported by an absolute congressional majority.
  On several occasions Max Fernandez has expressed his
dissatisfaction with his party's share of power in the
government, and criticized the president for not consulting with
him on important decisions before implementing them.
  As a result of the government pact signed with the MNR, the
UCS heads the Defense Ministry, some secretariats, and embassies.
  The other MNR ally is the social democratic Free Bolivia
Movement (MBL), whose seven deputies do not guarantee the
government's absolute majority. The MBL runs the Foreign
Ministry through its president [Antonio Aranibar] who is the
cabinet chief and foreign minister.
  The MNR has 52 of the 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies,
and depends on the 20 seats of the UCS to have an absolute
majority.

  [Text] Lima, 17 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori today said that during the Ibero-American summit in
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Latin America left rhetoric
behind and took concrete steps toward integration.
  When speaking of the results of the summit, Fujimori said
that "the most important thing is that concrete measures were
adopted and this represents considerable progress toward
regional integration."
  "This time the rhetoric was left aside and it was obvious
that each country was making an effort to form a Latin American
trade bloc to counterbalance the other blocs that exist in the
world," Fujimori said.
  The Peruvian president said that the economic section of the
final document issued in Cartagena contains several proposals
"which were planned based on the experience and modernization
process of the Peruvian economy."
  As for the political content of the declaration of the
Ibero-American chiefs of state and governments, Fujimori said
that the document "insists on the need for the democratic system
to work efficiently."
  He also mentioned that "it has been agreed that it is
necessary to combat all kinds of corruption which, just like
terrorism, is one of the scourges that hinders development and
the efficiency of democracy."
  Fujimori expressed satisfaction over the result of his
meetings in Cartagena with Ecuadoran President Sixto
Duran-Ballen and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.
  He and Duran-Ballen discussed several plans that would
integrate the two countries, such as highways and agricultural
projects, while he and Sanchez de Lozada spoke about giving
Bolivia an outlet to the sea through the southern Peruvian coast.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bolivian President Gonzalo </F>
Sanchez de Lozada by an unidentified EL PAIS reporter during his
visit to Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay for the Common Market
of the South, Mercosur, summit on 17 January]
  [Text] [EL PAIS] You have often said that Bolivia is trying
to be like "Dona Flor and her two husbands" [reference to novel
by Brazilian writer Jorge Amado]. What exactly does that mean?
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Well, I said that because, above all,
Bolivia has three destinies: one linked to the River Plate
region, another to the Amazon River region, and the third to the
Pacific Ocean. I think that beyond this remark, our presence
here in Uruguay is the result of our belief that our destiny
linked to the River Plate region is the strongest one. Our
immediate and future realities are closely linked to the
Parana-Paraguay River Waterway. We hope that, based on
agreements reached between Uruguay and Argentina, these two
countries can establish with the others that will join them in
this waterway an organization that can integrate them all. For
Bolivia, this waterway represents an outlet to the sea. It will
protect the eastern region of our country, where there is great
potential in the exploitation of iron, gas, and soybeans. In
this regard river transportation is really decisive. Our
presence and closeness with Mercosur becomes, therefore, a
priority. Just like Dona Flor, we would like to have two
husbands (Mercosur and the Andean Pact). It seems, however,
that our priority is Mercosur. This is why we want to hold
bold, but prudent, talks. We want to become part of the
locomotive instead of waiting to be run over by it. We believe
that the locomotive is here, that it is the critical argument
that will allow us to negotiate with the other economic blocs.
In addition to that, our destiny is closely linked to this
river basin that permits everything to become a unity instead of
a diversity.
  [EL PAIS] Why do you link the waterway to the River Plate?
Institutionally, they are two different things.
  [Sanchez de Lozada] It is very hard to separate a tree from
its roots. The whole thing begins here. We can separate the
two things, but we believe that our concept of fresh water and
cheap, effective transportation is a way of reaching the other
parts of the world. It is the destiny of all countries,
particularly the landlocked ones, to find a sea outlet. This
cannot be done unless we join the River Plate system. This is
not an imposition, but it seems to apply. In addition,
Argentina and Uruguay had to overcome several difficulties, and
needed a lot of time before achieving the experience they now
have. A joint administration is the first step toward achieving
an administrative system similar to those prevailing in several
other international river systems. It would be an
administrative support to this exceedingly complex system.
  [EL PAIS] Does Paraguay agree to this position?
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, I believe it does. We are very
close to Paraguay. Our relations have changed very much after
decades of susceptibilities and clashes resulting from the Chaco
War. In this radical change, the Bolivian and Paraguayan
leaders are reaching a level of relations that had already been
achieved by our peoples. I also believe that our landlocked
situation strongly unites us as a result of our geographical and
socioeconomic realities.
  [EL PAIS] You talked about the possibility of seeking a way
of integration between Bolivia and Mercosur through a free trade
zone. In this regard what could be obtained, taking into account
that for five years Bolivia cannot become a Mercosur member?
  [Sanchez de Lozada] ...No, in 1996... but if there is the
political will, we could become a member tomorrow. If there is
consensus, an exception could be made. This is what we seek:
By being an observer, we are linked to Mercosur; it is a bit
uncomfortable, but we are linked to it. Seeking a free trade
zone is like supporting Mercosur; although it is still not a
common market, it has no tariff. Therefore, it is a bit like
getting to the point where the other countries already are. And
as an observer, it is watching the negotiations for a free trade
agreement, trying to find the political, juridical, and economic
conditions to become a full member. But we must move with great
prudence and care, because we have other relations and
commitments. I came here above all seeking the political will of
the four countries to make Bolivia become a Mercosur member,
seeking a greater commitment. I believe there is a will;
otherwise I would have not been invited. But there is still a
long way to go. It is a way to open the path.
  [EL PAIS] Is your visit to Uruguay next March related to
this
issue?
  [Sanchez de Lozada] It has to do with this issue, but also
with the relations with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, which
are very important to us.
  [EL PAIS] Another issue proposed by Bolivia is the revival
of Urupabol [Permanent Joint Commission of Uruguay, Paraguay,
and Bolivia]. What use would you have for this group, which in
some ways already failed during the decade of the sixties?
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, it failed because that was another
time. I see the time as being very appropriate now, because it
involves three small countries. Uruguay is in another stage of
its socioeconomic development, just like Paraguay and Bolivia.
But if these countries unite, they can make a greater impact
under current conditions. I believe this is like a hand with
five fingers. And the three of us have to face the pressures
from Brazil and Argentina. Although the situation has changed,
the relative size of our countries make us feel united in many
ways, and there is also a lot of affinity and closeness on
international issues. There are historical interests, and
therefore it is a great advantage to have a common area. This
is something very informal, thank God, it is a wish, but
sometimes that is the most effective. Sometimes a friendship is
more valuable than an event.
  [EL PAIS] Your country has in the Andean Pact a special
treatment on tariffs. Would Bolivia be willing to accept
integration into a group like Mercosur, in which high tariffs
are proposed for some products to protect an industry? Would
your country be willing to join even when it has always enjoyed
low tariffs? Would it pay that price?
  [Sanchez de Lozada] We will see about paying the price. What
we want is to participate, and to convince the large nations
that high tariffs are a way of guaranteeing that their
industries will never be competitive. We are not dogmatic, but
a very poor country like Bolivia has come to the conclusion that
protectionism stops the absorption of advanced technology.
Because it is only human nature -- when a businessman is
protected, he will not seek competition. And one of the reasons
why we want to participate is because we believe that sometimes
logic, explanation, and experience have a great deal of
influence, especially in countries which are facing very
powerful sectors. It is like the case of an angel speaking in
one ear and the devil speaking in the other, but one must
listen. The exchange of experience is obviously important; if
one wants something valuable an effort must be made to get it.
But I believe one of the reasons why we want to participate
fully in Mercosur is because this process could stop. Bolivia
cannot force anybody, but it may have ideas for the future to
help this process come to a happy conclusion.
  [EL PAIS] From your point of view as Bolivian president,
what
is the future of the Andean Pact? Apparently there is a bloc
that functions well; Venezuela and Colombia, and the rest were
left behind.
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Yes, this is a complex situation.
Remember that for various reasons our activities and attention
have been especially dedicated to Chile and to Mercosur. We are
planning to start in the next few months to look at the real
situation of the Andean market. What happened is that the
domestic political struggle is so intense that I am only now
beginning to look at the world and the context in which the
country is living since I was inaugurated. Based on the
activities in which we are involved, we know there is a long way
to get there. But we are trying to get closer to Mercosur
because we believe it is more valid and hopeful.
  [EL PAIS] And how do you see the "Amazon Initiative" started
by Brazil?
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Brazil believes that this should be
enlarged, and that impulse should be given to a Latin American
free trade common market. But we believe this will not occur
until a locomotive exists. And the locomotive is Mercosur.
  [EL PAIS] How are current relations between your country and
Chile?
  [Sanchez de Lozada] I believe substantial changes have
occurred. My visit to Santiago, Chile, last October was very
important. Bolivia and Chile are changing a lot, and we do not
know what that means. But they are no longer the countries they
were. It is an irony, but sometimes countries change more
quickly than their leaders. We are carrying out polls in
Bolivia and Chile, and it seems that our people have left us
behind. We continue to look at the past, and they are looking
at the future. But sometimes deep inside people there are still
attitudes that only time will change. But we see changes among
people, such as Frei's election, and my election, representing
countries that are changing. Perhaps this means that problems
that had no solution will have one now, but I cannot guarantee
anything. One should be careful.
  [EL PAIS] Are there still talks on the issue of diplomatic
relations between Bolivia and Chile?
  [Sanchez de Lozada] I would say not. Some people in Chile
and Bolivia believe that the best of relations is not to have
relations, and there are other people who believe it is very
difficult to fight with someone if no relations exist. I
believe relations could be established very soon, or they could
be delayed. We want the steps to be taken to be not only
symbolic, but truly effective. We are not putting forward
conditions or demands, but want to move with boldness, but at
the same time prudence.

  [Excerpts] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada arrived this
morning at 0615 at the El Alto international airport. During
his 11-day trip the Bolivian president visited Cartagena,
Colombia, where he attended the Ibero-American summit; and the
United States, where he attended the inauguration of the World
Cup of soccer.
  During a news conference after his arrival, the president
discussed the Bolivian-German soccer match. [passage omitted]
  The president also referred to the sea outlet issue, which
was discussed both with Chilean President Eduardo Frei and at
the foreign ministerial level.
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We want to advance at all levels,
at the cultural, political, and economic levels, so that we can
succeed in our great objective of achieving an outlet to the
sea, both through the waterway and to the Pacific Ocean.
  I believe we had a good meeting, and that there is the
willingness to continue negotiating. I also explained that we
want to take specific steps to improve Bolivia's situation.
[end recording]
  Regarding capitalization, journalists asked him whether he
had been able during this trip to obtain more investments. He
said:
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We witnessed real interest in this
regard in the United States. For example, the Chicago Stock
Exchange will be sending a delegation to Bolivia. They are
interested in helping us establish a modern and fully
computerized stock exchange in Bolivia.
  I believe things are working out, step by step, in a
positive
manner, and that there is good acceptance. Obviously this
entails a lot of work, but I am optimistic. I believe we are
obtaining positive results. [end recording]
  President Sanchez de Lozada said that his administration
will
consist of several stages. He said the first stage is that of
sowing, which is the current stage.
  [Begin Sanchez recording] This stage consists of preparing
the soil, of sowing. It is a very austere stage, and people do
not always see results. Nevertheless it is a necessary stage,
as there is no harvest without a season of sowing.
  We are very confident that during the second year of this
administration we will be able to implement the capitalization
program. In other words, we estimate that by 6 August 1995 we
will have completed the capitalization process, and that the
pension funds will be operating by the end of next year. [end
recording]
  The president said that the harvest will be taken in during
the third year. He said that the last year of his
administration would be unquestionably a political year.
  Regarding the latest poll conducted by the Catholic
University of Bolivia, which indicates that Bolivian public
opinion believes a president should not also hold the post of
MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] leader, the president
said:
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We have a government system that
is similar to that of a parliamentary system of government.
Therefore, if a candidate lacks two-thirds, he has to go to
Congress and establish a coalition. This is why I am the leader
of a political coalition.
  This situation is not at all strange for Spain's Felipe
Gonzalez, or for German Chancellor Kohl, because if they intend
to implement their government programs they must be their
party's leaders and establish coalitions in order to be able to
govern. [passage omitted] [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- Today, the presidents of
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela reasserted their
commitment to the integration process of the Andean Group (GRAN)
or Cartagena Agreement on the occasion of its 25th anniversary.
  The five presidents expressed their support for the Andean
integration process in separate communiques issued here today by
the Cartagena Agreement Board (JUNAC), the GRAN's technical and
executive body.
  Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada stated the
common problems affecting Andean countries are the basic factor
in their unity. He added: "More than ever before, the
challenges and hopes the Andean Group represents still prevail."
  Sanchez de Lozada stated: "With our creativity and effort,
we still must strive to achieve a better life for our countries."
  His Colombian colleague, Cesar Gaviria, stated on the
occasion of GRAN's 25th anniversary, "we have to rejoice over
the implementation of this idea that has made a great
contribution to the unity of our countries." He added: "Today,
trade is the great force behind economic development,
integration, and the well-being of nations."
  Gaviria asserted that in these two and a half decades, GRAN
faced difficulties "because the prevailing protectionist
practices undermined commercial and integration processes."
  He added: "Today we hope the Andean Group will develop. We
also hope to establish a common export tariff, although we are
aware this does not constitute a goal in itself but a means for
achieving a free trade zone throughout the entire continent of
the Americas."
  Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen stressed the
"integrating tradition" of GRAN members and reasserted his
country's support for "the Andean integration process."
  Duran-Ballen stated the Andean Group faces the immediate
challenge of establishing an Andean free trade zone and helping
Andean countries achieve "a level of modernization and
proficiency that will allow them to achieve a definitive and
advantageous presence in the international market."
  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori stated that his country
shares with other Andean countries "a profound integrationist
spirit." Fujimori explained that Peru temporarily withdrew from
GRAN's economic process from August 1992 to April 1994 because
of the serious domestic crisis his country was experiencing.
  He added that today, Peru has been able to achieve economic
stability and has reassumed "with great enthusiasm, the noble
task we assumed with our Andean brothers a quarter of a century
ago."
  After noting that businessmen were skeptical about the
Andean
Group's success when it was implemented, Rafael Caldera, the
president of Venezuela, which joined the Andean Group 23 years
ago, praised the fact that private business has become the most
important integration force.
  Caldera added: "The celebration of the anniversary of one of
the most effective and auspicious Latin American integrationist
movements constitutes an auspicious event not only for its
members but for all developing countries."

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada believes all
alternatives must be sought for a sea outlet. He said this when
he arrived in our country after participating as a guest
observer in the fifth summit of Mercosur [Common Market of the
South] countries.
  As soon as he disembarked from the airplane, President
Sanchez de Lozada said the remarks he made in Colonia were
misinterpreted. In Colonia, he pointed out that Bolivia had
finally discovered its sea outlet through the waterway and that,
referring to the Pacific Ocean alternative, we had been looking
in the wrong direction:
  [Begin recording, in progress] ... in a wrong way. It was an
ironic, allegorical sentence, saying that, through the waterway,
we may hint at a sovereign outlet in a multinational way because
we would be using a Bolivian port through which we would
directly reach the Atlantic Ocean.
  Now then, this does not mean, as some people wanted to
interpret, that we have neglected our Amazon or Pacific destiny.
We have not neglected our Pacific reality, the necessity of
linking part of Bolivia, all of Bolivia, with the Pacific ports
and the Amazon region. That is another sea outlet. [end
recording]
  For the president, the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean through
the waterway is of great economic importance to our country
because agricultural products, raw materials, and even
manufactured products may be exported.
  Concerning Mercosur's acceptance of Bolivia as a guest
observer, journalists asked the president if this would entail a
departure from the Andean Pact:
  [Begin recording] We must talk with the Andean Pact people
and see if there is a way of approaching Mercosur without losing
contact with that Pacific bloc.
  These are things that we must view wisely, but our policy is
very effectively and very resolutely aimed at becoming a
Mercosur member. [end recording]
  The president also mentioned that a tripartite agreement
among Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia has been reached to
resolve the Pilcomayo River's environmental problems.

  [Text] President Fidel Castro broke away from the agenda of
the summit today and addressed the Ibero-American Summit after
the session for each of the participants to speak had ended.
Castro warned democracy must be understood within the context
of a great discussion among Latin Americans, and he demanded
solidarity for the people of Cuba who are suffering due to the
U.S. blockade, which he described as criminal. Castro requested
the floor from Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who
was presiding over this afternoon's session. Castro said:
  [Begin Castro recording] In conclusion, I will say I respect
your ideas. I sincerely respect your ideas, concepts, and
thoughts about democracy. We would have to hold a summit to
discuss what democracy is, what participation of the people is,
and why millions die in this hemisphere each year from disease
and hunger when they could be saved. [end recording]
  Following Castro's speech, Bolivian President Gonzalo
Sanchez
de Lozada responded, saying even though there is still much to
study and understand about the Cuban experience, he trusts that
democracy will come to the island and that Castro will be at the
head of a second Cuban revolution.
  [Begin Sanchez recording] Possibly [words indistinct], but I
know a change will occur, and we all wish you [words indistinct]
respect that all this [words indistinct] big river, big ocean
[word indistinct]. [end recording]
  This was the second time Castro addressed the summit. His
first speech was scheduled, the second was not. We asked
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo for his views
regarding Castro's speech. Gaviria said: The speech Cuban
President Fidel Castro made follows the pattern of words the
Cuban Government uses at international meetings. They never
sidetrack from this pattern. President Gaviria was also asked
what he thought of the fact that Castro was wearing civilian
clothes. Gaviria said: We were accustomed to seeing him in his
olive green uniform, but we saw him wearing a guayabera today.
It is an encouraging change, Gaviria said, adding there are
also encouraging signs for Latin American democracy.

  [Excerpt] Santiago, 14 Jun (EFE) -- Acting Chilean Foreign
Minister Jose Miguel Insulza has stated that "no important
announcements" will be made in Cartagena following the meetings
that Chilean President Eduardo Frei will hold with his Cuban
colleague Fidel Castro and his Bolivian colleague Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada.
  Insulza thus denied reports in Santiago that Chile and Cuba
will announce the resumption of diplomatic ties at the end of
the Ibero-American Summit, which starts today in Cartagena.
  Regarding Cuba, Insulza said: "It is not in our plans to
make
any specific announcement after this meeting (between Frei and
Castro)." He warned, however, that it is difficult to comment on
a meeting that will take place in the next couple of days.
  Chile and Cuba severed diplomatic ties in September 1973
following the coup d'etat perpetrated by General Augusto
Pinochet. Ties at the consular level were restored after the
first Ibero-American Summit that was held in Guadalajara
(Mexico).
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina is scheduled to make
an official visit to Chile in August. An announcement on the
resumption of diplomatic ties has been reportedly postponed
until then.
  As for the Bolivian issue, Insulza said nothing has changed.
He asserted that the Frei-Sanchez de Lozada meeting has "an open
agenda." He did confirm, however, that Bolivia's landlocked
issue will be discussed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- On Thursday, President
Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada spoke of the danger of
"narcoguerrilla" and powerful drug cartels like those of
Colombia developing in Bolivia if a general drug enforcement
policy is not quickly defined.
  Sanchez de Lozada said this new policy, which he will
present
to Congress next August, must not be imposed from abroad. He
spoke to a local newspaper, alluding to the problems created in
Bolivia by U.S. pressure to radicalize drug enforcement and to
eradicate coca plantations in El Chapare, the largest cocaine
raw material producing zone in the world. The chief of state
said: "Trafficking is a very serious problem for all sectors of
society and it affects Bolivian relations with the rest of the
world."
  The president said he was worried about the lack of a
consistent drug enforcement strategy. He stated that most of
the coca produced in El Chapare -- approximately 60,000 tonnes
per year -- ends up in drug production.
  "Nobody chews coca in El Chapare; coca produced in Yungas
region is taken to El Chapare, and it all goes to produce drugs.
The atmosphere in the region favors the establishment of drug
cartels or narcoguerrillas," Sanchez de Lozada said.
  Regarding the policy being prepared by his administration,
Sanchez de Lozada mentioned the creation of a National Drug
Enforcement Council presided by Foreign Minister Antonio
Aranibar and comprising Justice Minister Jorge Blattman,
Sustainable Development Minister Guillermo Justiniano, and
Minister of Government German Quiroga.
  This council must find solutions in Bolivia and not
solutions
imposed from abroad, the president said, adding that this
reorganization includes defining a policy toward the United
States. "This is a far too important for them (the United
States) because after many years they have recognized the need
for shared responsibility. It is our obligation to generate a
proposal that will really solve this problem," Sanchez de Lozada
said.

<F P=106> [Interview via satellite with Bolivian President Gonzalo </F>
Sanchez de Lozada in La Paz by reporter Jacobo Zabludovsky in
Mexico City; from the "24 Hours" newscast--live]
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Zabludovsky] How has drug
trafficking influenced or interfered in Bolivia's political life?
  Sanchez: Drug trafficking is one of the most
pressing problems confronting Bolivia. No one can explain why
we do not have narcoguerrillas or cartels similar to the ones in
Cali, for example. It is because social cohesion is very strong
in Bolivia. Family and community ties are very strong; at any
rate, the issue is one of concern, because we are a very fragile
nation. Our institutions are very vulnerable, and we are
apprehensive about this drug-trafficking issue.
  We are struggling hard against drug trafficking and seeking
strategies to convince the peasantry to become involved in other
activities. It is not an easy task, because there is poverty,
and one of the few things that produces revenue is the coca
plant, especially when it is refined into drugs. Despite all
this, we believe that if we can create enthusiasm for
industrialization or an alternate economic activity, we will be
able to find ways for the Bolivian people to abandon this
activity. It is not an activity we are interested in promoting,
given that it is so dangerous.
  Undoubtedly, this is one of the greatest challenges
confronting us, and we are all searching for solutions, not only
the government but society as a whole, because it is undermining
our youth. We are concerned that tomorrow it might undermine
our stability as well as our social harmony. [passage omitted]

region is taken to El Chapare, and all goes to produce drugs.
The atmosphere in the region favors the establishment of drug
cartels or narco-guerrillas," Sanchez de Lozada said.
  Regarding the policy being prepared by his administration,
Sanchez de Lozada mentioned the creation of a National Drug
Enforcement Council [Consejo Nacional de Lucha Contra el
Narcotrafico] presided by Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and
comprising Justice Minister Jorge Blattman, Sustainable
Development Minister Guillermo Justiniano, and Minister of
Government German Quiroga.
  This council must find solutions in Bolivia and not
solutions
imposed from abroad, the president said, adding that this
reorganization includes defining a policy toward the United
States.
  "This is far too important for them (the United States)
because after many years they have recognized the need for
shared responsibility. It is our obligation to generate a
proposal that will really solve this problem," Sanchez de Lozada
said.

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Mar -- Bolivian Foreign Minister
Antonio Aranibar said here today that U.S. Vice President Al
Gore is interested in knowing the positions of Bolivia,
Argentina, and Brazil regarding the continental summit organized
by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December in Miami.
  Bolivia was the first country visited by Gore on his tour to
these three countries. Aranibar met with the U.S. vice
president during the eight hours he was in Bolivia yesterday
before traveling to Buenos Aires, where he finds himself today.
  Aranibar told EFE that Gore had expressed his wish to
receive
from the Latin American leaders "topics for the future
inter-American dialogue," an initiative that demands appropriate
preparation.
  Gore also discussed drug enforcement with Bolivian President
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and other Bolivian personalities,
although it was "not the central subject" of conversation,
Aranibar said.
  Following his visit to Bolivia, Gore is currently in Buenos
Aires, from where he will travel to Brasilia, the last leg of
his Latin American tour. He will stay in Brasilia for six hours.
  The Bolivian foreign minister arrived today on an official
flight from La Paz to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers
of the Rio Group. The Rio Group is made up of 13 members:
Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela,
Paraguay, Uruguay, Mexico, Ecuador, Guatemala (representing
Central America), and Trinidad and Tobago (representing the
Caribbean).
  The 48-hour Rio Group meeting began today at Itamaraty
Palace, and is being held precisely to discuss positions for the
summit organized by Clinton, and for a preliminary document
prepared by experts from several governments and the Economic
Commission for Latin America, ECLA, on "poverty, the neglected
sectors, and unemployment."
  Regarding the summit in Miami, Aranibar said that the
countries of the continent must prepare "an agenda for the new
world" which must include the main subjects that will dominate
the inter-American dialogue in the next few years.
  He also said that certain subjects connected with economic
and social development, as well as regional integration --
including the possible membership of other Latin American
countries to the North American Free Trade Agreement among the
United States, Canada, and Mexico -- must also be included in
the agenda.
  According to Aranibar, the inter-American subjects for the
Miami summit must include participative democracy, the struggle
against corruption, the stability and solidness of the
democratic institutions, and rational development.

  [Excerpts] Bolivia and Paraguay have signed a letter of
intent that can open prospects for selling gas to that country.
This important document was signed during the visit Paraguayan
Foreign Minister Luis Ramirez Boettner is paying to Bolivia.
[passage omitted]
  The Bolivian foreign minister and his Paraguayan counterpart
today signed a major document of understanding that determinedly
supports the construction of a gas pipeline between Puerta
Grande, Bolivia, and Asuncion, Paraguay, for supplying Bolivian
natural and liquefied petroleum gas to that nation.
  [Begin Ramirez Boettner recording] I believe the work we did
yesterday afternoon and today to prepare for the visit Bolivian
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada will pay to Paraguay on 14
and 15 March has been very fruitful.
  Among the issues we addressed -- because we addressed
several
issues -- one of the more important is the one dealing with the
energy problem, that is, the possible sale of Bolivian gas to
Paraguay. [end recording].
  In addition to the Bolivian president's visit to Paraguay,
other major issues were considered like economic
supplementation; a tripartite agreement on the Pilcomayo River
by Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia; the Paraguay-Parana
waterway; and the Trans-Chaco Highway.
  Concerning the sale of gas to Paraguay, the price and volume
will be decided at a meeting of specialists from Bolivian
Government Oil Deposits and a Paraguayan private enterprise.
  The construction of the gas pipeline will be totally
financed
with private capital. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cochabamba, 24 Feb -- President Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada, commenting on the "rapprochement" with Chile, stated
here today that "diplomatic relations are not resumed based on
conditions; conditions are not established for this."
  He added: "It is when one sees that the Chilean people, the
Bolivian people, have experienced a true change in mentality
that there is true acceptance, that there is hope for
negotiations. Many people in Bolivia maintain that we must not
resume relations until we establish conditions, but this leads
nowhere. What one has to see is the moment in which the Chilean
people, the Bolivian people, are willing to start true talks,
negotiations, and thus work toward a first meeting."
  Sanchez de Lozada said that "things are changing rapidly,"
as
are the countries, and therefore this is "a subject that
requires, as I have stated before, audacity and prudence."
  The chief of state insisted that the subject must be handled
"seriously" because "domestic policy is one thing, and
international policy another." "There was a feeling that if I
attended this presidential inauguration [Chilean President-elect
Eduardo Frei's inauguration on 11 March] it would be a sort of
acknowledgement, a tacit resumption of diplomatic relations. I
think there are chances that this will happen at some point, but
I still do not have a deadline nor a date set for restoring
relations. We will see what happens with time, but we thought
this was not the appropriate moment. But neither was it a
matter of turning the invitation down, so we thought the best
solution would be to send someone close to me who at the same
time did not belong to the government, and I think we have come
up with an imaginative solution."
  However, consulted about the significance to Bolivia of the
landlocked subject, he said: "Well, the sea problem has existed
for more than 100 years, and we are not going to solve it with
my wife's visit, but it represents a rapprochement. It is very
hard to hold a dialogue with someone with whom you have no
relations. You must talk to reach an understanding. We believe
this was the adequate solution, and a step forward."
  Sanchez de Lozada referred to the invitation extended to him
by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin, which he termed
"important." The president ended by stating: "This is how one
starts a rapprochement, trying to find the right moment for this
rapprochement process so it can result in something concrete and
to the benefit of the Bolivian people."

<TEXT>
   Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the
governing party and Hugo Banzer, a former military dictator,
claimed victory Monday in a close presidential race, and Congress
will choose the winner.
   Officials said the outcome of Sunday's presidential and
congressional elections were an endorsement of the government's
economic austerity program, which both Banzer and Sanchez de Lozada
supported.
   Since none of the nine presidential candidates got a majority,
the new Congress will convene Aug. 4 to elect Bolivia's 77th
president, who will inaugurated two days later for a four-year term.
   ``The tendencies are clear,'' Sanchez de Lozada told a news
conference Monday. ``I will be the next president of Bolivia, and
my primary goals will be social programs and economic stability.''
   Jaime Cespedes, a spokesman for Banzer, claimed victory for his
party and said: ``We will not accept the victory of Sanchez de
Lozada because the only victory acceptable is that of the electoral
court. There is evidence to indicate fraud and the annulment of
votes favorable to Banzer.''
   Foreign observers who visited voting places throughout the
country reported some problems that appeared to stem from the
ignorance of rural electoral officials, but said they found no
evidence of widespread fraud.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard told journalists his office
monitored the vote in eight cities and found only minor
irregularities. He called it ``one of the most impressive Latin
American elections in contemporary times.''
   The electoral college is to present its final tally May 28.
   Bolivia's constitution requires Congress to choose the president
when no candidate gets a majority. The 27 seats in the Senate and
130 in the House of Deputies will be divided among the parties
according to the number of votes they received in each electoral
region.
   A projection by the private Bolivian Television Association said
Sanchez de Lozada's government party would gain four Senate seats
to 13 and Banzer's party would lose four, leaving it with five
members.
   It said Sanchez de Lozada would have 38 seats in the new Chamber
of Deputies, maintaining the current two-seat advantage over the 36
of Banzer's party.
   Eight other parties would share the rest of the seats.
   According to the Television Association's tally of 1,059,305
votes, an estimated 60 percent of those cast, Banzer and his
center-right Nationalist Democratic Action led with 284,028 votes,
or 26.8 percent, and Sanchez de Lozada of the conservative
Revolutionary Nationalist Movement was a close second with 279,385,
or 26.4 percent.
   Jaime Paz Zamora of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left was
third with 233,568 votes, or 22.1 percent, it said.
   The projection said Sanchez de Lozada probably would pull ahead
of Banzer by one or two percentage points when the vote came in
from rural areas, where early returns showed him with a solid lead.
That would put Sanchez de Lozada, 58, in a good position to win
congressional approval.
   Banzer, 62, seized power in 1971 and was forced out in 1978. He
said before the elections that all candidates should support the
one who won the most votes.
   Information Minister Herman Antelo told The Associated Press on
Monday: ``In the name of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, I would
like to express satisfaction for the form and results of the
election. Independently of who is the winner, more than two thirds
of the population has given its endorsement to the government's
economic policy and the need to continue with it.''
   The 81-year-old incumbent is retiring after a career that
spanned half a century and included three periods as president.
   Sanchez de Lozada, a wealthy mine owner, was educated in the
United States and has a philosophy degree from the University of
Chicago.
   Voting was calm and orderly in what once was the continent's
most politically volatile country. Since the turn of the century
there have been 13 coups, with nine governments between 1978 and
1982.
   Some irregularities were reported, including the arrest of three
people who carried several different identity cards and apparently
planned to vote several times. There also were reports that some
voters were given already marked ballots, but foreign observers
said they had no initial indications of widespread fraud.
   Paz Estenssoro said upon casting his ballot that the elections
would help lead Bolivians to political maturity. ``The important
thing is to consolidate democracy,'' he said.
   He launched a severe economic program when he took office in
1985 to halt economic chaos, including an annual inflation rate of
23,000 percent.
   Banzer, Sanchez de Lozada and Paz Zamora pledged to maintain the
program, which has cut inflation to 15 percent a year and
contributed to some small economic growth for the first time in a
decade.
   In addition, they all vowed to continue the government's battle
against cocaine production and trafficking. The United States
provides about $55 million a year for the efforts, which include
programs to reduce coca leaf cultivation in Bolivia's jungles.

  [Text] The presidents of Chile and Bolivia have been
invited to the Mercosur [Common Market of the South]
presidential meeting on 17 January. The Argentine delegation
made the proposal. [Chilean] President-elect Eduardo Frei is
also invited.
  Patricio Aylwin, Sanchez de Lozada, and Eduardo Frei will
hold complementary meetings with their Mercosur counterparts but
they will not formally participate in the deliberations.
  It is being reported in Santiago, Chile, that President
Patricio Aylwin is studying the possibility of attending the
summit, which will be held in Colonia on 17 January. The
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- the
Mercosur member countries -- invited Aylwin and also his elected
successor, Eduardo Frei, to participate.
  Frei is unable to attend; he is resting following a inguinal
hernia operation today. Chilean Foreign Ministry economic
delegation sources told the afternoon newspaper LA SEGUNDA that
Chile should send a high-ranking representation to the meeting,
even though it is not a Mercosur member and clearly cannot
become one.

  [Text] La Paz, 18 Mar (EFE) -- Expressing their position in
defense of coca, the Bolivian Labor Federation (COB) and the
Tahuantinsuyo Authentic Indian Front (FIAT) today labeled the
stopovers U.S. Vice President Al Gore will make in the La Paz
and Santa Cruz airports as "non grata."
  Gore, his wife, and official delegation are making their
first trip to several South American countries. They will make
a five-hour stopover in Bolivia on 20 March en route to Buenos
Aires, Argentina.
  Union leader Toribio Hinojosa said: "Mr. Gore's visit would
be fine if he came to make a commitment to stop the forced coca
eradication, but we know he comes to increase pressure for the
continuation of coca destruction."
  The FIAT issued a communique in which they say the U.S.
Government and vice president are "enemies of the sacred coca,
and he is coming to eradicate it."
  The greatest advantage will be taken from Gore's five-hour
stay in Bolivia on his way to Argentina. Official reports state
that he will be declared guest of honor in La Paz and Santa
Cruz, even though he will not visit those cities.
  Local officials are preparing a folk music show of the
Altiplano and the tropical regions, and will give him presents.
  During the 45-minute flight from La Paz to Santa Cruz, Gore
will meet with Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and
his Bolivian counterpart Victor Hugo Cardenas.
  Vice President Gore will also meet the Bolivian Government
economic team in the Santa Cruz Viru-Viru Airport.
  The Bolivian Government and the U.S. Embassy are working on
the final details of Gore's arrival in the midst of strict
security measures at the airports of the two cities.
  The highway from La Paz to Lake Titicaca will be closed for
about three hours and security will be strengthened at the two
airports to guarantee Gore's security.
  Gore will leave the La Paz El Alto international airport,
located about 15 km from downtown La Paz, for Achica Abajo -- by
Lake Titicaca -- which is the town where Bolivian Vice President
Cardenas was born. He will return to the airport and leave for
Santa Cruz.
  The signing of several agreements between the two
governments
was also announced and, if time allows, a brief meeting with the
media at the Santa Cruz airport will be held.

sector policy, which is being sponsored by peasant organizations.
  Wasmosy, accompanied by Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez
de
Lozada, will visit the Itaipu hydroelectric dam at 0700 and
visit Brazilian towns until the afternoon.
  Peasant organization leaders say Wasmosy's attitude shows he
has no vision of the real magnitude of the current conflict and
that he lacks the political will to give structural solutions to
the problem of land and the sale of cotton.
  After visiting Itaipu, Sanchez de Lozada and Wasmosy will
lunch in Foz de Iguazu and then visit the Brazilian city of Sao
Paulo to dedicate a sluice in a hydroelectric power plant in
Tiete River. For this reason he will not see the peasant protest.

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada used the
expression "one can drink milk without owning a cow" in his
proposal for an outlet to the Pacific Ocean without the need for
Bolivia to recover ownership of the territory it lost to Chile.
Opposition congressmen yesterday reported that Foreign Minister
Antonio Aranibar will be summoned to Congress to explain, in a
secret session, the content and scope of the president's
proposal.
  Sanchez de Lozada's proposal in Colombia has prompted
different reactions within the Bolivian opposition; while some
congressmen said he is giving up a century old national desire
for a "sovereign outlet to the sea," others called the proposal
an "interesting initiative."
  The most adamant opponents of that proposal are Nationalist
Democratic Action leader Jorge Landivar and Democratic Socialism
Alternative Deputy Jerjes Justiniano.
  Landivar said Sanchez de Lozada has been hasty in his
attempt
to solve the maritime issue, adding that the president's
proposal is some sort of a "tenancy agreement" because although
Bolivia will have an outlet to the sea, it will be through a
foreign territory.
  Justiniano said that we cannot give up a sovereign corridor
to the sea because this is the right of all Bolivians and
because it implies "treason to the fatherland."

  [Text] Santiago, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Open regionalism, growth
with social equity, and the strengthening of democracy are the
main proposals Chilean President Eduardo Frei will present to
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Chiefs of State and
Governments to be held on 14 and 15 June in Cartagena de Indias
(Colombia).
  This announcement was made by Foreign Relations Under
Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza, who said Frei will leave for
Cartagena on 13 June with a small delegation aboard a commercial
flight.
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will leave for
Cartagena on 11 June to attend the preparatory meetings at the
foreign minister level to decide on the proposals to be debated
by the chiefs of state and governments.
  Figueroa also confirmed that President Frei will meet with
Spanish King Juan Carlos. He will probably meet with Bolivian
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, and Cuban President Fidel
Castro. These meetings will depend on Frei's agenda.
  Insulza confirmed that the Chilean Government has approved
the agenda of the summit which will center mainly on economic
issues. He added that Frei will promote open regionalism, a
policy which Chile has successfully developed at the trade level
through bilateral and multilateral agreements.
  He said the Chilean Government wants a regional debate on
growth with equity because it considers overcoming poverty to be
the most important challenge for the countries of the region.
  Regarding democracy, Inzulza said Chile advocates a stronger
and better democracy in Ibero-America, efficient governments,
honest administrations, and modernization of the state.
  Inzulza added that Frei's proposals to the summit are
closely
linked to the general guidelines of his administration.
  Frei was inaugurated last March after winning the December
1993 elections with 58 percent of the vote. He chose as his
government priority the fight against poverty through growth
with equity.
  To do this he created a national commission to fight
poverty,
which affects 4 million Chileans; some 1.2 million live in
extreme poverty.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 13 Jun (EFE) -- On 13 June,
Chilean President Eduardo Frei said he had come to the Fourth
Ibero-American Summit to "reassert Chile's Latin American
spirit," a basic issue in its foreign policy.
  Frei recalled that during his presidential electoral
campaign, he stated that Latin America would be the main issue
in his foreign policy with prospects for political and economic
integration. He added that he has continued to uphold and put
this into practice since he came to power on 11 March.
  Frei told EFE: "It is true that Chile is a country open to
the world, that it is going to join the South Pacific Economic
Cooperation Conference (APEC), and that the EU is our main
commercial partner, but, regardless of this, Chile has a Latin
American spirit and we have come to reassert this."
  Frei added that sound evidence of this are the recent
proposals for a partnership with the Common Market of the South
(Mercosur) and the proposals Chile made during the recent OAS
General Assembly in Brazil.
  Upon joining the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will
last two days in Cartagena de Indias, he said Chile will
participate with the hope -- "and will make every effort
possible in this direction" -- that it will mark the starting
point, "in practice rather than in theory," of a real
integration of the hemisphere.
  The summit "must be the forum that will ensure Latin
America's transformation into a true community of nations in
which support for democracy, human rights, the struggle to
overcome poverty, and economic integration prevail."
  In Frei's opinion, the main thing to attaining these goals
is
commercial opening through negotiated agreements "with a spirit
of open regionalism" that will cast aside protectionism and
grant the continent access to the major markets, "free of
exclusions and closed blocs."
  The Chilean chief of state stressed: "This is what we have
come to propose at this Fourth Ibero-American Summit, and we
will do so with determination and an American spirit."
  Upon his arrival in Cartagena de Indias, Frei offered
Chile's
cooperation in rebuilding the towns of Caucas and Huilas, which
were devastated last week by the landslide caused by a tremor.
Frei reconfirmed this offer to EFE.
  Chile has already shipped 200 metric tons of aid for the
tragedy's victims, but Frei said: "We have talked to the
Colombian authorities about cooperating in the most difficult
aspects, that is, to rebuild the towns." Frei added:
"Unfortunately, Chile has great experience in natural disasters
and will place this experience at the service of our Colombian
brothers."
  Shortly after his arrival, the Chilean president held a
bilateral meeting with King Juan Carlos of Spain, whom he
invited to visit Chile again, specifically the Antarctic, which
is one of the king's "great desires."
  The respective foreign ministries will immediately start
working on the initiative to set a date, according to Frei, who
said he had asked for an audience with the king "for the
affection and support he always has granted Chile."
  Eduardo Frei is scheduled to hold two more bilateral
meetings
in Cartagena de Indias: one with Bolivian President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada on 15 June and one with Cuban President Fidel
Castro on 16 June.
  Frei said the two meetings will have an open agenda to
assess
the state of bilateral relations and cooperation prospects, but
dismissed the possibilities that an agreement to resume
diplomatic relations will be reached during either of the two
meetings.
