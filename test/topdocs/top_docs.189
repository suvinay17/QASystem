Saving the Cathedrals

   The sweetly malicious smile on the face of the angel on the facade of Reims Cathedral is the second most famous artistic grin in France. 
It is second, of course, only to that on the Mona Lisa. 
But whereas Leonardo da Vinci's smug lady behind her protective glass panel is safe from everything bar nuclear war, the smile on the angel could one day be nothing more than a postcard souvenir. 
For the pollution gnawing away at Reims and the other 86 cathedrals of France has caused more damage over the past 100 years than the monuments suffered during seven centuries or so. 

   The French government, after decades of financial neglect, has voted extra funds to help restore cathedrals. 
But the current allocation of $16 million a year is grossly insufficient to counteract the effects of atmospheric pollution, the subsiding of earth under foundations, and even damage dating back to the two World Wars. 
Budget-gobbling projects such as the Orsay Museum, the Bastille Opera and renovating the Louvre -- which alone cost almost $1 billion -- put solving the problem of the sad state of France's cathedrals into a back seat for a number of years. 
Most French people are unaware of the plight of their Romanesque and Gothic masterpieces, which are visited, free of charge, by around 100 million visitors every year. 

   Some cathedrals fare better than others. 
Chartres, for example, built in the early 13th century, is in fine health, thanks to the unusually high quality of its stone. 
But Strasbourg, built between the 11th and 14th centuries in red sandstone, has suffered from modern pollution. 
Only a quarter of the sculptures on its western facade are original. 
The Last Judgment frieze was replaced in the 1840s and the statues of the Apostles were resculpted in 1910 and again in 1983. 
The weak foundations of the northern tower were reinforced with concrete early this century, which has had the side effect of putting strain on other parts of the structure that now need to be consolidated. 

   Yves Boiret, architect in charge of 13th-century Reims Cathedral, faces two major problems. 
The first is filling in small and dangerous cracks in the northern tower, which was damaged during a World War I bombardment. 
The building caught fire and the roofing melted, sending molten lead gushing through the mouths of medieval gargoyles. 
For years the north tower was left unrepaired as a testimony to the wartime bombing, meaning that damage was aggravated with each spell of frost. 

   A more delicate task at Reims is restoring the cathedral's magnificent sculptures, which are under constant attack from humidity, atmospheric pollution and high winds. 

   Since the 1950s, when the cathedral began receiving attention, badly damaged statues have been replaced with stone copies that stand out from the rest because there is no way of artificially aging them. 
To make matters worse, the stone of Reims Cathedral is almost impossible to find in local quarries. 
Mr. Boiret is considering molding copies of statues in resinous materials covered with powdered stone. 
That leaves the question of where to store the damaged originals and whether to replace 13th-century works that are intact but that risk being eroded. 

   The Sainte Croix Cathedral of Orleans was built between 1599 and the early 19th century on the site of a previous cathedral destroyed by Protestants during the 16th-century Wars of Religion. 
Aesthetically and architecturally speaking, it is more of a curiosity than a thing of beauty, a Gothic structure built during a neoclassical period with more decorative stone swirls per pinnacle than anything built during the Middle Ages. 
Unfortunately those extravagantly pseudo-Gothic architects were so keen on being medieval that they forgot the basic masonic wisdom of putting in plenty of gutters and gargoyles to cope with rainwater. 
The Orleans cathedral is thus a sort of intricate stone sieve, continually being eaten away by rain -- a peeling, crumbling wreck built in the same creamy-colored stone as the chateaux of the Loire Valley. 

   It is an anthology of restoration problems. 
The foundations are poor. 
The stone is crumbly. 
Architects put no roofs in the western towers, leaving rain and bird droppings, which corrode stone, free to ooze down to ground level. 
Many of the stained glass windows have simply dropped out. 
The 11 chapels around the high altar have been abandoned for years -- damp, musty and littered with fallen paint work. 
A copious crop of moss lichen and grass is eating into the stonework. 
Replacement stone is hard to find. 
The clergy uses only a small part of the building for services and local people understandably tend to go to parish churches. 
Hardly any tourists visit. 

   Jacques Moulin, Orleans's architect inchief, is replacing some of the lost 19th-century stained glass by copying the original patterns. 
He also is inviting modern artists to contribute designs. 
And he is replacing stonework in the 19 flying buttresses that need repair, at the tune of $1.4 million per buttress. 
Unlike Mr. Boiret at Reims, Mr. Moulin is unwilling to use resin molding, preferring to keep France's 50 specialist sculptors in work. 
He has an annual budget of $1.25 million and could do with three times as much. 

   Neither the state nor the clergy can or will put forward so much money. 
"The money is there; it is just the will that is lacking," says Mr. Moulin. 
"That will only return when the monument is once again at the heart of public life, as it was in the Middle Ages."

<HEAD>Scientists Identify Part Of Brain Involved In Anxiety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   That anxiety and fear you feel when the dentist
says ``open up,'' or a police officer behind you turns on his red
light, triggers a reaction in the brain that has been measured for
the first time by scientists at Washington University in Saint Louis.
   The researchers tricked eight volunteers into a fearful
anticipation of pain from an electrical shock and then measured the
blood flow in their brains. The results for the first time
established the specific location of an emotion in the brain.
   Dr. Eric Reiman of Washington University said Friday in a
telephone interview that eight normal volunteers, being monitored by
a system called positron emission tomography (PET), were told they
would receive a painful shock through wires attached to their hands
some time during a two-minute period.
   The volunteers experienced a state of anxiety for 40 seconds
while anticipating the pain, and then they received a mild shock.
   Reiman said during those 40 seconds of anticipation, the PET
instrument detected a sharply increased flow of blood to the left
and right temporal lobes of the brain. These are located just behind
the eyes and just inside the temples.
   ``The reason regional blood flow is of interest is that it
actually reflects the activity of brain cells,'' said Reiman.
``Measurements of blood flow is a good way of identifying the
regions of the brain that are turned on during various thoughts,
feelings and behaviors.''
   PET works by detecting and measuring the very short-lived
radiation from a tracer injected into the blood stream just before
the test begins. The detectable radiation lasts only two minutes.
   Three scans were taken with each volunteer _ the first to get a
baseline without anxiety, the second when the anxiety was induced
and a third scan for a follow-up comparison.
   Reiman said that by inducing anxiety in the volunteers, the
researchers were able to compare the blood flow pattern in normal,
anxious brains with that of patients who experience panic disorder,
an emotional illness that includes unprovoked and inappropriate
feelings of great fear and anxiety.
   In earlier PET studies, he said, the researchers learned that
patients with panic disorder also experience a sharply increased
flow of blood to the temporal lobes of the brain, the same areas
affected by the normal anxiety felt among the volunteers in the
study. This finding, said Reiman, gives important new information
that may be a first step toward eventual control of panic disorder.
   ``When we identify the regions of the brain that are functioning
abnormally in panic disorder, hopefully we will be able to design
and target treatments that specifically address those parts of the
brain,'' he said.
   The same technique may be used in exploring which parts of the
brain are involved in other feelings.
   ``I do believe we'll be able to develop procedures to induce
other normal emotions in the laboratory and identify portions of the
brain involved in sadness or joy or anger,'' said Reiman.
   Understanding the physical effects of these emotions could lead
to treatments for other disorders, he said.
   Participating in the research with Reiman were Drs. Marcus
Raichle and Peter Fox, and Maureen Fusselman, all of Washington
University.
   A report on the study was published Friday in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advance of Science.

<HEAD>Cadillac Dealer Decries Local Cadillac Ads As Japanese-Bashing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A local car dealer is blasting as racist a
regional Cadillac television ad campaign that uses World War II
footage to depict the downfall of Japanese auto competitors.
   Mark Hennessy, owner of Hennessy Cadillac-Jaguar in Atlanta,
placed ads in Friday's editions of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
denouncing the ad campaign by ``The Cadillac Dealers of the South.''
   His ads called the campaign obscene, racist and an admission by
the company ``that Cadillac is not marketable against Japanese
luxury cars on a feature for feature or value for dollar basis.''
   The ads use World War II footage depicting a dogfight _
representing the competition between American and Japanese cars _
with the slogan, ``Out of the land of the rising sun comes the land
of rising prices.'' It shows a Japanese Zero fighter plane crashing
into the ocean as the announcer says, ``Compared to Cadillacs, our
competitors are real zeros.
   ``It's a xenophobic fear of the Japanese culture,'' Hennessy
said Friday in an interview.
   Hennessy _ whose dealership also sells the Japanese-made Lexus _
said he first complained about the ads during a special screening
for dealers last month. He said he told both Cadillac zone managers
and representatives of the ad agency, Babbit &amp; Reiman, that the ads
would offend Cadillac owners and scare away potential customers.
   ``The ads give the idea that we as Cadillac dealers aren't
selling our cars ... on the basis of value but that we have to just
rely on emotion,'' he said. ``I'm selling due to the quality of the
car and the quality of my employees and loyalty of my owner case.''
   He also said Cadillac owners and potential customers have been
calling his company to complain since the television ads first
aired.
   Paul Schmidt, Atlanta zone manager for Cadillac, did not return
phone calls Friday.
   But Joey Reiman, chairman of Babbit &amp; Reiman, said his agency's
campaign is being misinterpreted.
   ``Our job is to sell Cadillacs for Southeastern Cadillac
dealers. This TV spot does just that,'' he said. ``Our targets are
veterans who can't understand why their children are not buying
American cars.
   ``The real zeros here are people who are taking this too
seriously.''
   The ads are being run throughout the South on behalf of more
than 193 Southern Cadillac dealers.
   Reiman said the campaign is not racist. He said another ad in
the campaign, which has not been aired yet, targets Lincoln cars.
This ad features images of Abraham Lincoln and says, ``Take it from
Lincoln, buy a Cadillac.''
   ``It's not just the Japanese we're after, it's all
competition,'' Reiman said.
   Reiman also said Hennessy may be upset about the ad because his
dealership also sells Japanese cars.
   But Hennessy said he designed his newspaper ad to ``apologize to
any of our customers or prospective customers who may be offended
by these ads.''
   ``I'm not on a soapbox, I'm just trying to protect the business
my family built over 26 years,'' he said.

<DESCRIPT>  WINTER; HOLIDAY; DESIGN  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  ON A sunny but nippy morning earlier this month, 20 women gathered on the
grounds of the Allied Arts Guild in Menlo Park. Equipped with hot cider, wire
clippers, ribbons, glue guns and a variety of other implements, they had come
to learn how to make the perfect Christmas wreath.;   Displayed were five
beautifully made designer wreaths -- the objects of their aspirations. These
wreaths were something to behold. Each had careful and intricate designs with
fancy gold-edged ribbons, pine cones nestling in Noble fir foliage, tiny
tangerines spiked with cloves, chili peppers, gilded holly leaves, red
berries, blue berries, you name it. They were all gorgeous.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  BEGINNERS MAKE A BOUGH TO THE ART OF THE PERFECT
WREATH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Is it possible to produce one of that caliber on your first go? I asked
Mary Ancell, the chairwoman of the event, which was held to aid Stanford
Children's Hospital.;   "Absolutely!" she beamed. Ancell, I could tell, was an
optimist. Some of the participants weren't. But fortunately there were five
optimistic designer-helpers circling the tables that Ancell had set up to aid
those who were flummoxed.;   Patience, patience;   Louise, the bow-maker, was
most in demand. "To make the perfect bow you must fold and scrunch, fold and
scrunch," she repeated. In seconds she'd made a variety of bows -- tapestry
ones, gilt ones, just regular ribbon ones. "Some of this material costs $8 a
yard," she muttered. "You don't want to mess up.";   The key to making a good
bow?;   "Patience," she said. "After you've done about 100 it becomes easy."; 
 Janet Reimers was looking a little unsure of herself as she attempted to
insert a bunch of juniper berries into her wreath. "I'm going to put this
inside my entry hall," she said. "I hope it'll look attractive.";   Sheila,
another designer-helper, suggested that she fix the junipers to the wreath
with the glue gun. "It's absolutely fascinating," Reimers said. "You'll be
copying something else, and your own personal style will come out. It's
yours!";   What Reimers was trying to create was a copy of a tapestry wreath
that was displayed up front. It includes two yards of tapestry ribbon, four
yards of gold-edged Burgundy ribbon, some fresh juniper berries, two bunches
of red hydrangea and two bunches of blue hydrangea. This wreath retails for
$70.;   A monster of a deal;   The wreath-making class has proved to be in
great demand this year. Ancell originally scheduled one class, but that filled
up so quickly that she added another. That too filled, and there were still
calls coming. "I think I've created a monster," she said.;   But for a $25 fee
-- which includes light refreshments, the basic Noble fir-and-wire wreath
(which retails for $12.50), the use of all the equipment and the instruction
-- the class is a great deal.;   It is possible, Ancell said, to start from
scratch and make your own wire wreath and add the foliage, but that's very
time-consuming and not the fun part. But if you do want to make a wreath, she
suggested, go out and pillage your yard. Shake down your pine trees, go to
Portola Valley and look for Spanish moss, find some eucalyptus leaves. All of
these will look lovely on a wreath, and some of them will make your home smell
nice too.;   She added that she's not surprised that her class has proved so
popular. "It's for a good cause, it's in a beautiful setting, it's well-priced
and it's the Christmas season," she said. "When they walk out of here there'll
be big smiles and a pretty wreath under their arm."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>`Cat Lady' Dies After Being Hospitalized For Hypothermia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOODLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   O. Clara Sager, a popular eccentric who
loved cats and insisted on living atop a pile of trash outside her
house, died after being hospitalized for exposure. She was 91.
   Sager, known to her neighbors as the ``Cat Lady,'' was taken by
ambulance to Yolo General Hospital here Tuesday morning. When she
was admitted, her body temperature was 84 degrees and she was
suffering from hypothermia, said Yolo County Deputy Coroner William
Long.
   Overnight temperatures have dropped into the 20s and 30s in
recent weeks. Despite the chill, Sager continued to stay where she
has for decades _ outside the front of her house in nearby Winters
on a tarpaulin-covered pile of trash, protected by an umbrella.
   The Rev. John Reimers, pastor of the Pioneer Presbyterian Church,
said he has known Sager for 25 years.
   ``She chose her lifestyle and lived it to the end,'' Reimers said.
   The minister said Sager had been ill for 10 days and had been
taking medication. He and other neighbors in Winters, a town of
2,650 about 20 miles west of Sacramento, were concerned about her
welfare; they called a doctor Tuesday after she became confused.
   ``She kept telling us she was better. Her hands were not cold,''
he said.
   Now Reimers said he must find homes for Sager's 16 cats. Some
were said to be strays people had abandoned hoping the ``Cat Lady''
would care for them.
   ``We'll have to make some decisions concerning them. Clara won't
be there to feed them twice a day,'' he said.
   Reimers described Sager as a collector and an avid reader of
newspapers who was interested in civic affairs. She sang in his
church's choir and participated in its women's groups until
arthritis made it difficult for her to walk.
   Inside her house were 1,200 books, enough furniture for several
houses and many pretty glass items such as vases, he said.
   ``Many tried to get her to change her style of living. She
pointed out that Indians lived outside all the time,'' Reimers said.

<HEAD>Amish Abate Opposition To Immunizations To Fight Measles Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW WILMINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Amish communities in
northwestern Pennsylvania have dropped their normal opposition to
immunizations and sent 125 children to get shots to fight an
outbreak of measles.
   ``Our concern right now is mainly with the Amish,'' said Bruce
Reimer, spokesman for the state Health Department. ``Most do not
accept immunizations and our fear is that it will get into other
pockets of Amish.
   ``This is the time of year when many will travel to other areas
to visit family and friends, and a lot of weddings will be going
on. There is a potential for spreading.''
   Reimer said the first reports of measles among Amish occurred in
Lawrence and Mercer counties in the northwestern part of the state
in early December. He said the outbreak is apparently ``pretty much
nipped'' after 142 confirmed cases in four months.
   Reimer said Monday there appears to be no outbreak of measles
among the state's largest concentration of Amish in Lancaster
County in southeastern Pennsylvania.
   Carlos Flores, a pediatrician, said two special clinics in New
Wilmington inoculated 125 Amish children and young adults on
Friday. Some arrived in traditional horse-drawn buggies. He said
his office has scheduled more inoculations for Friday.
   ``Some of the Amish people tell their daughters and sons that
it's worse if they have the shot than if they had the diesease.
It's not true,'' Flores said. ``They're spreading that word among
them. The side effects of measles alone can be more dangerous.''
   Flores said only about 20 percent of Amish in his practice
follow normal inoculation patterns against disease.
   The measles outbreak forced three of 10 Amish schools to close
in Lawrence and Mercer counties, two because students were ill and
one because a teacher was ill, officials said. Two schools remained
closed through last week, officials said.
   ``We have nurses in the area talking to the Amish bishops,
trying to locate additional cases,'' Reimer said. ``Getting
information from the Amish is difficult.''

JUDGE OKS PLAN FOR HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
RULING CLEARS WAY FOR $922-MILLION OVERHAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $922-million plan for new office buildings, hotels, shops and apartment 
buildings in downtown Hollywood was adopted fairly and according to law, 
despite charges that the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency acted 
fraudulently and violated state guidelines in drafting it, a Superior Court 
judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the long-awaited ruling, Judge Barnet M. Cooperman removed the last major 
hurdle blocking a major overhaul of the community's commercial sections. 
Proponents of the plan, including Hollywood-area City Councilman Michael Woo, 
hailed the decision as a milestone in the long, arduous effort to revive the 
flagging movie capital. 
</P>
<P>
"What we had was a resounding victory for those who want Hollywood to move 
forward," Woo said of the ruling. "I think a cloud has been lifted from above 
Hollywood. Now we're going to be able to move faster than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year redevelopment plan, adopted by the City Council in early 1986, 
provides a basic development blueprint for an area of 35,000 residents -- the 
most populous redevelopment zone ever established in Los Angeles. The plan 
seeks to foster development in 1,100 acres encompassing the busy Hollywood and 
Sunset boulevards. The plan, for example, envisions new buildings and modern 
storefronts around such tourist attractions as Mann's Chinese Theatre and the 
corner of Hollywood and Vine. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and big-business interests have fought bitterly over the plan almost 
since it was proposed in 1983. Residents, fearful of worsening traffic 
congestion and possible condemnation of homes, battled to defeat the plan or to 
substantially reduce the amount of development it allowed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Larger-Scale Development 
</P>
<P>
Big-business interests -- including landowners such as Pantages Theatres, 
Golden West Broadcasters and Sunset-Gower Studios -- favored a plan permitting 
larger-scale development. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, representing most 
of those landowners, was able to control more than half the seats on the 
25-member citizens committee that helped to draft the plan under state 
redevelopment guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Although the final plan contained significant compromises on zoning issues, it 
was seen as favoring large-landowner interests. Residents filed suit soon after 
the plan was adopted, alleging that the City Council and redevelopment agency 
pushed for redevelopment against the interests of homeowners whose concerns 
were not adequately considered. The suit charged that the CRA conspired with 
the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to stack the citizens committee and thus 
draft a plan favorable to big business. 
</P>
<P>
The court, noting the seriousness of the charges, took months to review the 
10,000 pages of records on which the lawsuit was based, Cooperman said. The 
judge on Friday reported finding no evidence of wrongdoing during any part of 
the plan's preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"The case has been a complicated and time-consuming one," Cooperman said. "The 
allegation of fraud is serious. The court very carefully considered the 
evidence, and the plaintiffs, in the court's judgment, produced no credible 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they would consider appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a press conference Friday, Woo and CRA Chairman Jim Wood 
confidently predicted that the ruling would mean an end to a troublesome 
roadblock. Because of the lawsuit, they said, the county had been withholding 
property-tax revenues set aside each year for Hollywood's redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Those frozen funds now total $1.6 million, CRA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The end of the lawsuit . . . frees up that money," Woo said. "We (no longer) 
have to operate on a shoestring." 
</P>
<P>
Although the CRA has begun spending some money in Hollywood, the agency now 
will be able to pour in substantially more to begin paying for improvements 
such as parking structures, low- and moderate-income housing, and social 
programs. The property taxes available for Hollywood are expected to increase 
substantially each year as real estate values escalate. It is hoped that public 
spending by the CRA will in turn draw increasing numbers of private developers 
to Hollywood, spawning both commercial construction and new housing. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, the area's first two major commercial projects are expected to 
break ground near the busy corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
400-Room Hotel 
</P>
<P>
The largest, the Hollywood Promenade, is expected to bring a 400-room high-rise 
hotel, an entertainment museum and a multimillion-dollar office complex to 
vacant land surrounding Mann's Chinese Theatre. That project -- unsuccessfully 
challenged in a separate lawsuit -- is expected to be completed near the end of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance away, on the site of a torn-down hotel, the Hollywood Galaxy 
project is planned to include six movie theaters, outdoor restaurants and a 
number of retail shops, plus an underground garage. That project may be 
completed even earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Welsh, president of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said more is on the 
way. Architects are rumored to be designing a new entertainment center on 
Pantages Theatres property near Hollywood and Vine, he said, and plans are 
under way for a remodeling of the old Paramount Theatre building. 
</P>
<P>
Additional developers will likely move into Hollywood now that the legal 
challenge to redevelopment is apparently over, Welsh predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this opens the gates," he said. "It was an exciting day for us in 
Hollywood . . . who believe in the redevelopment of this world-famous area. I 
realize that very probably the verdict will be appealed, but I'm very pleased 
with the judge's extensive research before rendering his verdict. That 
encourages me to think that the opinion will be sustained on appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Residents, who deplored the prospect of significant new development, said they 
hope to challenge the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Norton Halper, a member of the citizens group Save Hollywood Our Town, which 
filed the suit, said large-scale commercial development would destroy the 
community flavor that exists in much of the project area. "It's not all 
run-down; it's a very nice area here," Halper said. "The community atmosphere . 
. . will be destroyed to make Hollywood a big entertainment center." 
</P>
<P>
SHOT member Brian Moore said: "This judge disagrees with the citizens of 
Hollywood. We definitely expect to appeal. We always said it would be decided 
in the appellate court." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncertain on Appeal 
</P>
<P>
But homeowners' attorney Christopher Sutton expressed uncertainty about an 
appeal. Legal fees so far have totaled $300,000 to $400,000, he said, and 
residents have raised less than $60,000 to offset them. His law office has 
handled most of the case as a public service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Praising Cooperman as a fair and thorough judge, Sutton said his case was 
hampered because testimony was limited to the 10,000-page administrative 
record. Additional testimony that might have persuaded the judge of fraud was 
not admitted during the months of trial because the scope of the trial was very 
narrowly drawn, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to rely on testimony from (the CRA's) own staff," Sutton said. "They 
were free, I believe, to testify to suit themselves. In my opinion, I think 
there was creative testimony and convenient memories" on the part of CRA staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
CRA attorney Kay Reiman called the assertions "sour grapes." Reiman said the 
voluminous public record and the dozens of witnesses gave Sutton more than 
enough opportunity to present his case. 
</P>
<P>
"He had his shot," she said. "That was it." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he now hopes to ease some of the bitterness that has divided the 
community.

PHOENIX SHUTS OUT THE GULLS, 7-0

<P>
Indirectly, San Diego can blame Los Angeles for its latest bruise, as Phoenix 
defeated the Gulls, 7-0, in an International Hockey League game Tuesday night 
before 3,743 at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Raiders beat up on the Chargers, Monday a thick blanket of smog 
drifted south from the L.A. basin, and Tuesday, Phoenix, a team almost solely 
supplied by the Kings, handed the Gulls their worst loss and second shutout of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say, it was just one of those nights," said goaltender Mark Reimer, 
who allowed four goals before he was pulled with four minutes remaining in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
Gulls' Coach Mike O'Connell found nothing to cheer about Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"They score seven goals on us, that's embarrassing," he said. "They got some 
soft goals on us, that hurt. But we're focusing on the puck too much and not 
the man." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix (3-3-1) scored three goals in the second and third periods, and for the 
eighth time this season, the Gulls (2-5-1) outshot their opponents, this time 
30-24. 
</P>
<P>
Even the first San Diego appearance of 12-year NHL veteran goalie Glen Hanlon, 
acquired last week from Detroit, failed to help the Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Mark Reimer started the game with a 2-1-1 record, but was pulled after 
Phoenix scored once in the first period and three times in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 4-0, Steve Graves, Sean Whyte and Brian Lawton scored the last three 
goals of the night, all off Hanlon, to give Phoenix a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After giving up two goals, which put the Gulls behind, 2-0, the next two, both 
in the second period, seemed to catch Reimer off guard. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:52 in the second, Lawton scored from the right circle to put Phoenix 
ahead, 3-0. The puck took a slow roll and bowled over Reimer, who ended up 
sprawled on his back trying to make the save. 
</P>
<P>
Graves became Reimer's next nightmare, never stopping his skating stride as he 
backhanded a shot from the slot. Reimer appeared to have made the save with his 
right hand, but he lost his grip on it and the puck sank into the net for a 4-0 
Phoenix lead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gulls Notes 
</P>
<P>
On the road again: The Arizona State Fair will keep Phoenix out of the Arizona 
Veterans Coliseum until Nov. 1, when it will play its first home game against 
Muskegon (Mich.). "I'm reasonably satisfied with our start," Phoenix General 
Manager Adam Keller said of his team, which has played nine games on the road. 
"It's a long trip and the guys are a bit weary, but as long as we can come out 
with a couple of points . . . " Keller was a defenseman and captain of the old 
Roadrunners, when Phoenix and the original Gulls were Western Professional 
Hockey League archrivals. He recalled there was never a problem getting 
mentally ready to play San Diego. . . . It was old home week for Keller, 
Phoenix owner Lyle Abraham, and six of the Gulls -- Jim McGeough, Carl Mokosak, 
Brent Sapergia, Larry Floyd, Robbie Nichols and Dave Korol -- who played for 
the Roadrunners last year. "You should be very grateful to us," Keller said. . 
. . Charlie Simmer, Gulls' assistant coach and left wing, is still nursing an 
injured ankle. Center Darcy Norton injured an ankle Friday against Indianapolis 
and is listed as probable for Thursday's game. . . . Left wing Steve Martinson, 
who played in 48 NHL games for Detroit and Montreal from 1987 to 1988, and 
defenseman Derek Mayer, from Detroit's top farm team, were added to the Gulls' 
roster Tuesday. Right wing Paul Kelly and left wing Jacques Mailhot were 
released.

FT  07 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Le Pen attacks 'treason'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   REIMS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right French National Front,
yesterday stepped up his call for his countrymen to mobilise against the
'felons' in their government who had committed 'treason' by signing the
Maastricht treaty on European union, writes David Buchan in Reims.
In the heart of the champagne country he held his rally against the historic
backdrop of Reims cathedral, site of the baptism of Clovis, King of the
Franks, in the 5th century and of the coronation of subsequent French kings.
The archbishop cancelled Sunday morning services to keep the Front out of
the cathedral itself.
Hammering home calls for 'judgment and punishment' in the September 20
referendum, Mr Le Pen suggested that he and others in the No camp would have
handled President Francois Mitterrand far more toughly in last Thursday's TV
debate than the lacklustre neo-Gaullist, Mr Philippe Seguin. The president's
choice of Mr Seguin as sparring partner, Mr Le Pen told 2,000 supporters,
was all part of the 'manipulation' of French public opinion by its political
establishment.
Judging by the Reims crowd, Mr Le Pen is not succeeding in using Maastricht
to recruit many anti-EC rejectionists from other parties, which all have
their own No candidates.

<HEADLINE>  PALMER'S 10TH-INNING HOMER PUTS WIN OUT OF REACH
FOR A'S  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Was he simply trying to get a handle on what had happened? Or was the glare
what it seemed -- a death stare intended for Rickey Henderson, who had knocked
Palmer's warning-track flyball over the left-field fence Saturday for the
winning three-run homer in Texas' 6-3, 10-inning victory over the A's.;   "Oh,
no, I was just depressed," Eckersley said.;   "I didn't see the ball bounce
up. I thought (Henderson) had it. I said, 'Yes!' Then I said, 'No!' ";  
Eckersley, who also allowed a double to Palmer in the ninth, found it a
maddening way to give up his 11th homer in 74 1/3 innings.;   "Dean Palmer . .
. The guy's hitting a buck-98, and he runs into two balls on me," he said,
with several expletives deleted. "I wish he would have hit it into the second
deck. Then you can't second-guess anything.";   If Henderson had made the play
on Palmer, it would have been his only catch of the day.;   In the first
inning, he stood flat-footed as Brian Downing's flyball bounced off the top of
the left-field fence for a double. Later in the first, Henderson either got a
late jump or was nonchalant on Ruben Sierra's line drive, which caromed off
the bottom of the fence for a double.;   In the fourth, Geno Petralli hit a
foul ball to left. Henderson arrived late and attempted a basket catch, but
the ball popped out for an error.;   On Palmer's homer, A's Manager Tony La
Russa agreed that it was a flyball nudged over the fence by the backside of
the leaping Henderson's glove. But La Russa also took part in damage control,
sticking up for his left fielder by noting that Texas' Kevin Reimer also had
problems out there.;   "There wasn't one guy in left field today who didn't
struggle out there with the sun," La Russa said.;   "Either everyone was lazy
today or having trouble picking it up.";   Of course, that's been the debate
on Henderson all season. Is he dogging it, or is he merely misunderstood?;  
As you're mulling that over, it should be noted that although Reimer said the
sun indeed was troublesome, that wasn't what caused him to give up on a
routine flyball hit by Ernest Riles in the first -- undoubtedly, the play
referred to by La Russa. That ball fell for a double, but according to Reimer
it was a byproduct of a diving catch he made on Henderson's line drive the
previous play.;   "My glasses got all muddy (on the diving catch)," Reimer
said. "Instead of calling time, I put them on my head and said I'd clean them
in a hurry between batters. Sure enough, the next pitch . . .";   If Henderson
had any similar excuses, he wasn't telling.; HOW THEY SCORED;   Rangers 1st --
Downing doubled. Franco singled, scoring Downing. Palmeiro reached first on a
fielder's choice, Franco forced at second. Sierra doubled, moving Palmeiro to
third. Reimer's sacrifice fly scored Palmeiro. Rangers 2, A's 0.;   Rangers

<LEADPARA>  It was the A's season, wrapped up in a tidy package. Well, not so tidy,
actually.;   The A's bottom-of-the-ninth, 4-3 loss to the Texas Rangers on
Friday night was as messily assembled as this season has been. There were
three errors, two on the same play, missed cutoff men, walks and 10 stranded
runners.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A'S FIND LEAD TOO HARD TO HOLD -- AGAIN
11-11 FINISH FOR STEWART  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Dave Stewart, finishing a long season at 11-11, thought the conclusion
fitting.;   "That has a lot to do with the reason why we're in the position
we're in right now," he said. "The way we played tonight is the way we played
all season long.";   Stewart faulted himself, too, because he gave up a
ninth-inning single and walked .190 hitter Dean Palmer to set up Mike
Stanley's game-winning RBI single to right field. Even at that, right fielder
Jose Canseco could have bailed the A's out with a strong throw. He ran down
the ball, which slipped out of his glove when he crashed into the wall. He
hesitated to pick it up and make the throw, and the winning run scored.;  
"Actually, when I hit off the wall, it kind of shook me," said Canseco.;   The
Rangers had opened the door for an A's win with a spectacular collision
between left fielder Kevin Reimer and rookie shortstop Jose Hernandez on pinch
hitter Ernest Riles' shallow flyball to left field in the ninth.;   Hernandez
ranged back, colliding violently with Reimer. Hernandez collapsed to the
ground and the ball ricocheted away from Reimer as Riles raced around the
bases. Center fielder Gary Pettis collected the ball and threw it in,
preventing Riles from scoring. And the A's took it from there.;   After
Hernandez was carried off the field on a stretcher by his teammates -- he was
taken to Arlington Memorial Hospital for X-rays of a possible collarbone
fracture -- the A's got down to the business of squandering a gimme.;  
Pitcher Terry Matthews got Rickey Henderson on a called third strike. Dave
Henderson popped up to first. Jose Canseco was issued an intentional walk, and
that met with boos from the Rangers' fans, who liked the potential for drama
with Canseco at the plate.;   Kenny Rogers came in to face Harold Baines, who
had hit homer No. 20 in the fifth. And Baines, one of the few guys the A's
could turn to this season, failed too, flying out to center.; HOW THEY SCORED;
Rangers 1st -- Franco doubled with one out. Palmeiro singled, scoring Franco.
Rangers 1, A's 0.;   A's 3rd -- R. Henderson homered with one out. A's 1,
Rangers 1.;   A's 5th -- D. Henderson walked with one out. With two out,
Baines homered. A's 3, Rangers 1.;   Rangers 6th -- Franco doubled. With two
out, Pettis singled, scoring Franco, and took second on the throw home; Pettis
took third on catcher Steinbach's throwing error and scored on Steinbach's
fielding error. Rangers 3, A's 3.;   Rangers 9th -- Reimer singled with one
out. Palmer walked, moving Reimer to second. Stanley singled, scoring Reimer.

<LEADPARA>  The bullpen let down the A's again Thursday night. That's like turning the key
in the Rolls-Royce and the car won't start.;    Dennis Eckersley, of all
people, gave up a two-run, game-tying homer in the eighth to Juan Gonzalez,
and Gene Nelson completed the damage by feeding a game-winning homer to
slumping Kevin Reimer in the 10th that lifted the Texas Rangers over the A's
5-4.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A'S RELIEF FALTERS AGAIN
NELSON, ECKERSLEY GIVE UP HOME RUNS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "We're not using everyone the way we did in the past," pitching coach Dave
Duncan said about a bullpen that has been recuperating from various injuries
all season. "That's going to come sometime in the future, in about two weeks.
Right now, we're not functioning the way we're supposed to.";    The comeback
that gave the Rangers their fifth victory in six games against the A's this
season spoiled the effect of Rickey Henderson's first career grand slam, a
blast that put the A's up 4-2 in the seventh.;    Once upon a recent time,
letting the A's take the lead in the late innings was death to opponents.
Manager Tony La Russa pushed the familiar buttons and ended up with nothing
but a short circuit.;    Todd Burns got a couple of outs in relief of starter
Mike Moore. Curt Young retired his man.;    That left it up to the impregnable
Eck, who had sailed through his previous 14 save chances without a miss. He
entered with a clean slate, opening the eighth and the first two outs were
easy.;    Then Reimer, a left-handed batter, grounded it the other way into
the shortstop hole. Mike Gallego made a fine play to glove it, but couldn't
fire the ball to first in time.;    "I would have had him if I hadn't
double-clutched," Gallego said. "I just didn't get it out clean the first time
and he just beat it. A split second is all it takes.";    Three pitches later,
21-year-old Juan Gonzalez, one of the future stars of this league, parked an
Eckersley fastball 426 feet away into the left-center field bleachers, the
longest homer this season in Arlington Stadium.;    "It looked like it was
going to be easy," said Eckersley, who hadn't given up a homer or earned run
since Carlton Fisk homered off him June 3 in Chicago. "I was aware of
Gonzalez. He has serious power.";    Asked if the once-vaunted bullpen was its
old self, Eckersley said, "Not right now. We haven't been doing the job.";   
Nelson, roughed up Tuesday in the series opener, also had two out when Reimer
struck for his fourth homer of the season, a line shot on a 1-and-0 offering.
Reimer had hit into a double play and struck out twice before his single that
snapped a 2-for-14 spell.;    Reimer ran around the bases as if the ball
hadn't cleared the fence. Nelson trudged off slowly, dragging his 10.70 ERA
with him. He was too disconsolate to talk afterward. Even his young son sat in
the clubhouse with his head hanging.;    All the runs in the game scored on
homers. Moore, fighting a strained groin muscle, nicked lead-off batter Dean
Palmer on his batting helmet in the first inning and Rafael Palmeiro followed
with a homer for 2-0.;    That didn't seem to matter when Henderson slammed
Texas starter Gerald Alexander. But it did, and left La Russa sounding like
the lawyer while defending his relievers.;    "It was just a tough assignment
getting six outs in this ballpark," La Russa said. "I feel very comfortable
going to the bullpen. It's going to be a real bonus for us in the Kansas City
series.";    A man can hope.;  HOW THEY SCORED;    Rangers 1st -- Palmer hit
by pitch. Palmeiro homered. Rangers 2, A's 0;    A's 7th -- McGwire singled.
Quirk singled, moving McGwire to second. Blankenship ran for McGwire. Gallego
bunted into fielder's choice, forcing Blankenship at third and moving Quirk to
second. Steinbach, pinch hitting for Bordick, walked, moving Quirk to third
and Gallego to second. R.Henderson homered. A's 4, Rangers 2.;    Rangers 8th

4, A's 4.;    Rangers 10th -- Nelson pitching. With two out, Reimer homered.

<HEAD>Albanians Head For Reception Centers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIPPE LARUE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MARSEILLE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a warm reception, more than 500
Albanian refugees headed north today to reception centers where
they were to be taught French and learn about their new country.
   Eight of the refugees were hospitalized with what the Red Cross
said were unspecified benign ailments. Most of the rest of the 544
Albanians who arrived in Marseille Sunday were sent on special
trains to Reims, on the way to three reception centers outside
Paris.
   The Interior Ministry will give temporary residence permits to
the refugees, many of whom are gypsies. All have the right to apply
for political asylum.
   The refugees are the last arrivals of about 5,000 Albanians who
boarded five ferries seeking asylum in Western Europe. Albanians
began rushing into foreign embassies in the capital of Tirana on
June 28 after word spread of a family that had been allowed to
emigrate to Italy after spending five years in the Italian Embassy
seeking political asylum.
   The majority of the refugees _ some 3,000 _ traveled to West
Germany during the weekend after about 4,500 refugees were ferried
from Albania to the southern Italian port of Brindisi.
   Italian and Egyptian officials reported today that no new
Albanians had sought asylum in their embassies in Tirana, the
Albanian capital. The Czechoslovak Embassy and the Hungarian
mission were reported empty of refugees.
   The Red Cross conducted preliminary health checks on the latest
arrivals on the train and at Reims. The refugees were then broken
up into three groups and bused to Creil, Emance and Mourmelon in
the Paris region.
   ``The health of most of the refugees is good,'' said a Red Cross
spokesmen in Reims. ``But they all need rest.''
   Carrying little luggage and dressed for the most part in
T-shirts, simple trousers, sandals or clothing donated by the crew
of the ferry Orient Star, the tired refugees settled into their
temporary quarters in Reims for a long sleep. Soldiers had
stockpiled 160 gallons of beverages and 660 pounds of fruit for
their arrival.
   About 30 others arrived earlier by bus at another way station in
Perigueux, southwestern France. Extremely tired, they turned down a
prepared meal and simply asked for drinks and cigarettes.
   Several wept as they got off the bus. Most said all they wanted
was sleep. They were later driven to two separate camps.
   They were jubilant on their arrival in Marseille, crying ``Long
live France'' in Albanian and ``Long live the Albanian people'' as
they disembarked.
   They then sang the Marseillaise, the French national anthem,
just as they had done as their ferry docked in this French port.
   Geological engineer Arian Cipa, who arrived in Marseille Sunday,
summed up the problems of his homeland: ``No freedom. No money. No
future,'' he said.
   ``I could no longer tolerate the complete absence of freedom in
my country,'' the 25-year-old said. ``I know it won't be easy for
me in France, but I hope to succeed. I won't go back to Albania
until the Communists are gone.''
   Cipa took refuge in the French Embassy in Tirana for eight days
before a U.N.-mediated settlement allowed him and thousands of
others to leave for the West.
   The secretary of state for humanitarian action, Bernard
Kouchner, escorted them to special trains bound for reception
centers where fresh clothes, soap and toothpaste awaited.

<TEXT>
   Journalists from the Soviet Union and
the United States ended a conference by stressing the need for more
``citizen diplomacy'' between the superpowers.
   ``Twenty bridges are better than one,'' Nickolai Reimers, editor
of Science and Life Journal in Moscow, said on the last day of the
five-day conference Friday.
   ``If we paired people up by interests, paired up the exchanges,
it would be a new step,'' Reimers said through a translator.
   The conference at Connecticut College, sponsored by the New
England Society of Newspaper Editors and the Union of Soviet
Journalists, brought together nine Soviet journalists and nine from
the United States.
   ``We need more depth of exchange,'' said Viachislav Pohvalski,
editor of Zaporozhskaya Pravda in Moscow. ``It is part of a
citizens' diplomacy, which is more important than the official
diplomacy.''
   Reimers said he would like to see the two organizations set up
permanent teams of journalists to work together on stories and
projects all over the world.
   Steve Riley, editor of the Central Maine Morning Sentinel in
Waterville, said he corresponds with a Soviet newspaper editor, and
the two papers exchange news stories and columns, but have not been
able to arrange a visit. He agreed it would be a major step forward
if individual exchanges could take place.
   Sergey Runov, a member of the board of the Union of Soviet
Journalists, said the two groups could hold joint seminars and
lectures and swap journalists. Such an exchange, he said, would
allow people could learn the truth about each nation, not just the
propaganda.
   Even without exchanges, the groups have made progress in thawing
Soviet-American relations, said Bernard Caughey, an editor at the
Patriot Ledger in Quincy, Mass.
   ``We have a saying in the United States,'' Caughey said. ``It is
better to light one little candle than to curse the darkness. We've
been at this a long while. I'd like to think we lit a few of those
candles, and you in return lit candles. It has been worth the
effort.''
   Journalists from both nations discovered they had similar
problems in trying to obtain information for stories.
   One Soviet journalist said not everyone welcomes perestroika,
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program, and said the
Soviet media has been criticized for playing a large part in
opening the government up to examination and question.
   Maura Casey, an editorial writer with The Day in New London,
said the most valuable aspect of the conference was meeting Soviet
counterparts.
   ``All the stereotypes I grew up with are meaningless when you
look into a person's eyes,'' she said.

<HEAD>With BC-AIDS Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A transvestite and a toddler with AIDS-related complex are
living together in an ususual foster parenting arrangement, as
officials increasingly look to non-traditional care for a growing
number of children with the disease.
   ``We have to aggressively search out foster parents,'' said
Norman Reim, a spokesman for the New Jersey Division of Youth and
Family Services. ``New Jersey is breaking new ground in the nation
in the way it handles pediatric AIDS cases.''
   Of the 164 New Jersey children who have tested positive for the
AIDS virus, the majority are with relatives, but 46 are in foster
care and five are at a group home in Elizabeth, Reim said.
   His agency agreed to let a reporter visit the transvestite
foster parent and child only on condition that their hometown and
names not be disclosed.
   ``Bobby,'' as the foster parent will be called here, says his
life has been fulfilling since he brought home 3-year-old ``Kevin''
in December.
   They live in an old neighborhood, where drug addicts and
alcoholics hang out on street corners. The toddler is never far
from Bobby's side.
   ``I've had to cut back on entertaining my girlfriends,'' Bobby
said, referring to his transvestite friends. ``That's the hardest
thing. ... But I have to be careful about who comes in now.''
   He acknowledges his homosexuality and his penchant for living
like a woman and wearing feminine clothing and jewelry. Since
becoming a foster parent he has stopped working as a female
impersonator, he said.
   He wants Kevin, who doesn't know he's a man, to think of his
foster parent as an aunt.
   ``I don't want Kevin to call me `mom' because I'm not his
mother,'' he said. ``If I kept him, as he got older I would have to
someday explain my lifestyle to him.
   ``You know, we're all people, regardless of our lifestyles.
We're all God's people, and the way we dress or act doesn't make us
love any differently,'' he said. ``My sexual preference is
different, but nothing else is.''
   Bobby's male companion does not live at the house, but is a
frequent visitor. In the course of their relationship, Bobby
decided he wanted the fulfillment of a child.
   ``I went to see DYFS, and I was a little surprised that they
even talked to me,'' he said. ``They came out to inspect my home,
but I really didn't think it would go through. People are
stereotyped about gay people.''
   When the state approached Bobby about caring for an AIDS child,
he was skeptical.
   ``Then I realized that these kids don't get the love they should
get,'' he said. ``Most people don't want sick children, especially
children with AIDS. They see them, they think they're cute, but
they don't want them.
   ``The first time I went to the hospital to see him, I thought he
would be a little, sickly thing, but he's an adorable little kid.''
   State officials say they don't question a foster parent
applicant's sexual preference.
   ``When we evaluate a home, we check to see if the individual or
the people who will be parents in the home are able to provide a
loving, safe, nurturing atmosphere,'' Reim said.
   Foster parents who care for AIDS children receive $700 a month
and another stipend depending on how sick the child is, compared
with the average of $215 per month for foster children who are not
ill, Reim said.
   ``This is a new set of incentives to try and recruit foster
parents to take care of kids with AIDS,'' he said.
   ``You also have to realize that some of these children sometimes
need more intensive care, and sometimes will require a parent to be
home full-time,'' Reim said. ``You need to compensate them for
that.''
   Before Bobby could take Kevin home, he had to take extensive
lessons on how to care for an AIDS child. Rubber gloves must be
worn when changing diapers. The bathtub must be scrubbed with
bleach after each bath. Kevin must be closely watched when playing
with other children.
   ``Wearing gloves just kills me,'' Bobby said. ``To me, you pick
up trash and garbage with rubber gloves.
   ``But to me, it's basic care,'' he said. ``When he looks at me
with those eyes at night and hugs me before he goes to sleep,
there's no money in the world that can buy that feeling.''
   One of the harshest realities, however, is realizing that Kevin
may not live long.
   ``If he grows up to be 15 or 16, I'd be happy,'' Bobby said.

Few of its players are among Orange County's top batters, but Foothill High 
School's starting lineup ranks among the best hitting teams in the area with 10 
players batting .300 or better. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill displayed all of its offensive prowess on Friday with every player in 
the lineup getting at least one hit in a 10-2 victory over host Santa Ana in a 
Century League game. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill (14-7 overall, 8-3 in league play) had 17 hits and had at least one 
hit in every inning. Catcher Scott Barton, pitcher Kent Donnelly and left 
fielder Tom Hawkins had three hits each. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly (6-3) pitched a four-hitter and struck out seven. Santiago Lopez 
scored the only earned run off Donnelly with a home run in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Donnelly quieted a good hitting team, retiring the last 10 batters 
as Foothill rebounded from a 3-2 loss to Santa Ana on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had nine hits against them on Tuesday. The only problem was that we didn't 
get the hits when we needed them," said Jerry Sedoo, Foothill coach. "We don't 
hit for power, but we are capable of hitting." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights have had at least 10 hits in seven games this season and came 
within one hit of their season-high of 18 against Santa Ana Valley on April 18. 
Donnelly, a junior, hit two doubles and a single and drove in three runs to 
lead the attack Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be a dominating player next year," said Bill Ross, Santa Ana coach. 
"This was a game they had to win. The game that was critical to us was on 
Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana (13-8, 8-3) has struggled this season without its top pitcher, Bob 
Reimers, who has experienced arm trouble. Reimers threw for the first time in 
the late innings against Foothill, but he hardly looked like the pitcher who 
won nine games last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder where we could be if Reimers was healthy," Ross said. "After you get 
past Jesse Rosas, we don't have much pitching. I'm not taking anything away 
from Foothill, but we didn't have much going for us on the mound today." 
</P>
<P>
Starter Victor Rios (4-3) was chased in the fourth inning when Foothill scored 
four runs to take a 6-1 lead. Santa Ana committed two errors in the inning as 
Foothill sent nine batters to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill added three hits in the fifth and sixth innings, then four more in the 
seventh. 
</P>

<LEADPARA>  Juan Gonzalez ended the A's season with his two-out, two-run homer in the
bottom of the ninth Sunday. It figured.;   "It's about like it's been. Close.

<TEXT>     Honeycutt entered the game with a runner on first and one out. He struck
out pinch hitter Brian Downing, then gave up homer No. 27 for Gonzalez. It was
his first since Aug. 27.;   The game mattered to the A's, or at least to La
Russa, more than you'd think. To the winner went third place in the American
League West and the few thousand dollars per team member after shares are
figured. So, the Rangers finished third for the second consecutive season.;  
Mike Moore finished 17-8 with a 2.96 ERA but didn't get the satisfaction of
winning his final start. He dueled Nolan Ryan for six innings, giving up four
hits and two runs before departing because of a split fingernail on the index
finger of his pitching hand.;   Moore's scoreless streak ended at 25 2/3
innings when Kevin Reimer doubled to open the bottom of the second, went to
third on a sacrifice and scored on a grounder.;   Lance Blankenship assisted
Moore's cause with a single to drive in a first-inning run. He also doubled,
stole second and scored on a throwing error in the sixth.;   But Blankenship
couldn't come through with the bases loaded in the seventh, popping out to
second for the third out.;   Ryan lasted seven innings, giving up three hits
and striking out 10. He finished the season with 203 strikeouts, his 15th
200-strikeout season.;   La Russa closed the doors for one final meeting after
the game.;   "I just said goodbye, basically," he said.; ETC.: Julio Franco's
first-inning single gave him 200 hits, and he became the third Rangers player
to reach 200 this season. Only three teams since 1938 have had three players
with 200 hits. The two others were the '63 St. Louis Cardinals and the '82
Milwaukee Brewers. . . . Mark McGwire was out of the starting lineup for the
second consecutive game, ensuring that he'd keep his average at .200 or
better. He began the day at .201, and an 0 for 4 would have dropped him under
.200. La Russa inserted him in the bottom of the seventh and McGwire didn't
bat.; HOW THEY SCORED;   A's 1st -- R.Henderson walked and stole second.
Blankenship singled, scoring R.Henderson. A's 1, Rangers 0.;   Rangers 2nd --
Reimer doubled. Palmer walked. Stanley sacrificed Reimer to third and Palmer
to second. Huson grounded out, scoring Reimer. Rangers 1, A's 1.;   Rangers
5th -- Pettis walked, stole second and moved to third on Daugherty's
groundout. Franco grounded into fielder's choice, Pettis out at home. Palmeiro
doubled, scoring Franco. Rangers 2, A's 1.;   A's 6th -- Blankenship doubled,
stole third, and on catcher Stanley's throwing error, scored. A's 2, Rangers
2.;   Rangers 9th -- With one out, Huson walked. Honeycutt relieved Nelson.

ANTELOPE VALLEY STAYS UNBEATEN WITH 43-7 WIN OVER EAST L. A.

<P>
Ask any player on the Antelope Valley College football team about it and he 
will give the same answer: Coach Brent Carder is still running a conservative, 
take-no-big-chances, make-no-mistakes offense. 
</P>
<P>
The execution has improved recently, though, and so have the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still running the same basic plays," Antelope Valley tailback Steve 
Miller said. "It's just that now, our offense is coming together. The offensive 
line really did a great job tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's 217 yards rushing in 16 carries and two touchdowns underscored that 
performance as the Marauders routed East Los Angeles, 43-7, in a Foothill 
Conference game at home Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Antelope Valley's overall record to 5-0-1 (3-0-1 in 
conference play). It is the Marauders' best start since the 1954 season when 
they finished 10-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that we were capable of playing like this," Miller said. "It just took 
us a while to get going." 
</P>
<P>
After scoring 80 points in its first four games, Antelope Valley has scored 77 
points in its past two. 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders set one school record and tied another against the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Washington and tight end Thomas Reimer combined on a 98-yard touchdown 
play to set one record, and Miller's 95-yard run in the third quarter tied 
another. 
</P>
<P>
One constant throughout the season has been the Antelope Valley defense. 
</P>
<P>
Against East L. A., the Marauders forced five turnovers (two fumbles and three 
interceptions) and held quarterback Santiago Alvarez to seven completions in 21 
attempts for 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez had completed 60% of his passes for 896 yards and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley led, 30-7, at halftime, with the Marauders converting three 
Husky turnovers into 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies' Steven Dumas fumbled the opening kickoff and Jason Camp kicked a 
38-yard field goal to give Antelope Valley a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
On the Huskies' next series, Mike Gilliam fumbled and Antelope Valley strong 
safety Rick Starling recovered at the East L. A. 35-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Miller took a pitch and went 30 yards around right end for a 
touchdown that gave Antelope Valley a 10-0 lead with 10 minutes 30 seconds left 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley's usually conservative offense produced a big play after an 
East L. A. punt had pinned the Marauders on their two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Washington hit Reimer with a short pass over the middle on first down and 
Reimer broke Armando Torres' tackle and rumbled down the left sideline for the 
school-record touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The score remained 17-0 until midway through the second quarter. John Johnson 
intercepted his fourth pass of the season and returned it to Antelope Valley's 
23-yard line. Three plays later, Tony Simmons turned a draw play into a 51-yard 
touchdown.

  [Text] Tallinn, 30 March -- Head of the 3d department of 
Estonian Defence Forces Headquarters Valdo Reiman told ETA that 
state defence departments intended to call about a thousand 
Estonians to the regular military service this spring. 
  Every year there are about 4,000 conscripts in Estonia and 
they are called to join the Army twice a year, in spring and in 
autumn. 
  Less than three thousand conscripts serve in the Estonian 
Defence Forces, the rest being professionals, volunteers, etc. 
  Only Estonian citizens that have become 19 years old can be 
conscribed to military service. 
  Reiman said that a major problem is constituted by men who 
have Estonian citizenship, but whose knowledge of Estonian is 
poor or who do not speak Estonian at all. He added that these 
people amounted to 10-15 per cent of the defence forces, the 
largest number of them in Viru and Kalevi battalions that are 
located at the north-eastern predominantly Russian-speaking 
region. Head of the Kalev battalion Alar Laneman admitted that 
Russians were mostly good soldiers and the authorities have 
tried to distribute them to the units so that they would be 
forced to speak Estonian to learn the language.

<LEADPARA>  After showing such resiliency earlier this season, the A's are on the verge of
letting things slip away. And A's Manager Tony La Russa was concerned enough
to hold a team meeting after Wednesday's loss dropped the A's another rung.;  
 La Russa lifted a weary Mike Moore after 5 1/3 shutout innings, even though
Moore was working on a one-hitter. The A's bullpen couldn't hold a 1-0 lead.
Gene Nelson staggered through another outing, hindered by a pivotal error by
Rickey Henderson in the Texas Rangers' six-run seventh, and the Rangers went
on to win 8-1.  </LEADPARA>

Highlight: Gene Nelson gave up five runs in a third of an inning in a six-run
Texas seventh.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The A's ninth loss in their last 12 games dropped them into third place in
the American League West. The A's remain 4 1/2 games behind the Minnesota
Twins, and they're a game behind the California Angels. They're only a
half-game up on the Rangers and a game ahead of the fifth-place Seattle
Mariners.;    And they were definitely in La Russa's doghouse Wednesday night,
because the manager saw troubling signs.;    "This game doesn't hurt. This
game upsets because we didn't play as hard and as good as we can," he said.;  
 La Russa wouldn't elaborate on what he saw, saying, "Body language. I know
these guys' bodies, and the language wasn't right.;    "It's not what the A's
represent. I think we can fix that. I'm upset because I think if we play as
hard as we can and as good as we can, there's not a seven-run difference in
that game. That's as far as I'll go.";    La Russa held a meeting with his
players after the game, although he refused to acknowledge that he had done
so.;    "I believe that when you have something you want to say to the club,
it's something that stays with the club," he said. "And I never have really
gotten great vibes when I read or hear about other guys being public with the
fact that they had a meeting or what they said in the meeting.;    "It never
hits me right, so it's going to be rare that you'll know when I have a
meeting.";    But a player said that La Russa had reminded the A's to play
hard.;    "I don't think we need to be motivated, but we're human. We need to
be reminded," he said.;    It seems almost strange that the A's would need to
be reminded because they played so hard earlier this season. They've fought
through injury after injury, and they didn't fall out of first until June 17.;
   "We're trying to break out of it somehow. It hasn't been easy. This is the
toughest we've been up against," A's reliever Dennis Eckersley said. "We just
don't want to throw away what we have, because we had something going. We
fought our (butts) off. We're just trying to keep it together so we can get it
together.;    "You don't want to throw away all that we've done. I think
that's a motivator in itself.";    Moore's effort was wasted Wednesday. He was
done early because he had thrown 154 pitches in Boston last Friday.;    "He
had got really extended in Boston. He was pitching a day short and he was
starting to get stiff," La Russa said.;    With a runner on first in the
seventh, Kevin Reimer dropped a single into left and Henderson ran by the ball
for an error. With runners at second and third, the A's decided to
intentionally walk Juan Gonzalez. Steve Buechele followed with a three-run
triple off Nelson, and the Rangers went on to score six in the inning.; ...;
HOW THEY SCORED; A's 4th -- With two out, Riles and Quirk walked. Blankenship
singled, scoring Riles. A's 1, Rangers 0.;    Rangers 7th -- Sierra walked.
Nelson relieved Young. Franco was safe at first on a fielder's choice, forcing
Sierra at second. Reimer singled, moving Franco to second, and on left fielder
R.Henderson's fielding error, Franco went to third and Reimer went to second.
Gonzalez was intentionally walked. Buechele tripled, scoring Franco, Reimer
and Gonzalez. Rodriguez singled, scoring Buechele. Huson doubled, scoring
Rodriguez. Palmer singled, scoring Huson scored. Guzman relieved Nelson.
Rangers 6, A's 1.;    Rangers 8th -- Sierra doubled. Franco walked. Stanley

FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (9): Capacity soars - Memory
Technology / Further big increases in portables' memory capacity are on the
way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEMICONDUCTOR technology is readily predictable. This makes it a relatively
simple task to work out what the future for portable computer memory
capacities will be like. The real question, therefore, is not how much
memory can be made available, but how it is to be exploited.
Random access memory (RAM) chips, the most commonly used in personal
computers, now hold 4 megabits (MBits) of data, equal to 0.5 megabyte
(MByte) or roughly equivalent to some 85,000 words. Over the next year, the
first examples of chips with four times that capacity, 16Mbits, (2 MBytes or
nearly 350,000 words) will start to appear.
Top-end portable computers already come with around 4 Mbytes of RAM as their
main user memory, so it is relatively easy to predict that this will rise
over the coming years to 16 Mbytes, and then 64 MBytes (roughly 10m words).
The same chips can and will be used in smaller portable computers as well,
such as the popular notebook machines, and the handheld 'palmtop' and pen
computer systems.
In terms of memory capacity and processor performance, there is now only one
technical reason why the capabilities of the largest desktop PC cannot be
put into a palmtop machine, and that is the display technology available.
There was one other technology hindering such a development, the magnetic
disk drives used for on-line data and program storage, but at a technical
level this has largely been overcome by the growing availability of cards
built to the standard defined by the Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association (PCMCIA), which numbers over 180 computer
companies in its membership, many of them leaders in their field.
This standard exploits the increasing capacity and functionality of
semiconductor technology to, at the base level, provide an alternative to
the magnetic disk drive for small portable computers.
The technology developed for the PCMCIA standard, however, is capable of
providing much more than just memory capacity. It can couple that capacity
with additional functionality and intelligence. This is not to suggest that
the magnetic disk drive has lost its role in portables. The technology
continues to be developed aggressively, with both the physical size of the
units and the cost-per-megabyte stored coming down rapidly.
Physically, disk sizes of 2.5 ins diameter are now commonplace, with
capacities of 20 MBytes and 40 MBytes now typical. This will rise to 60
MBytes and 80 MBytes this year, according to leading drive manufacturer,
Conner Peripherals.
At Pounds 10 per megabyte stored on a Conner 40 MByte drive, it is
impossible for semiconductor technology to beat disks on price. In terms of
size, unit price and capacity, therefore, the majority of laptop and
notebook portables will still be using magnetic disk drives.
Their one major weakness - power consumption - will be tackled in part by
the reduced physical size of the drive motor and actuators needed, and in
part by improving software to manage the power consumption. There is little
chance, however, of this weakness being overcome sufficiently to accommodate
the needs of the growing palmtop computer market.
Users here are seeking longer than three to four hours working life from
their batteries, a capability the smallest hard disk drives cannot provide,
even if the latest developments of 1.5 ins diameter disks means that
credit-card-sized units can be produced.
It is with the palmtop machines that the PCMCIA standard card format is
starting to make an impact, though its presence is starting to be felt in
notebook portables as well. The standard defines a physical form factor for
add-in cards - about the size of three or four credit cards stacked one on
top of another. It also defines the connector pin-out and what can be
achieved with them.
The objective, as with all standards, is to have as many hardware suppliers
using it as possible, thus creating a market for card suppliers in all their
guises. This is greatly helped by the convergence last year of PCMCIA
standards with those of the Japan Electronics Industry Development
Association, (JEIDA).
The two are now claimed to be fully compatible, allowing JEIDA-standard
cards to be used in PCMCIA-compliant computers and vice versa. The most
obvious guise for PCMCIA cards is as a hard disk alternative. Here a variety
of solutions are on offer, including battery-backed RAM chips linked
together as a module.
More recently, flash memory technology, a variant of electrically erasable
programmable read only memory (EEPROM) technology from companies such as
Intel, has come to the fore. For systems designers, the trade-off between
the two is capacity, price and flexibility.
RAM-based units currently hold more data, but need to have a small lithium
battery as part of the card design, in order to maintain the data as stored.
Typical capacities to date are up to 10 MBytes per card, though Santa Clara,
California-based SunDisk, the company of PCMCIA president, Mr John Reimer,
claims the lead with a 15 MByte card.
Predictions are for 100 MByte cards to be available within three years,
though these will not beat magnetic disks on price per megabyte stored.
Flash memory, on the other hand, retains the data as a read-only memory
(ROM) does, without any need to keep refreshing it, but allows the system to
re-write the data as required. This is analogous to magnetic media.
According to Mr Reimer, the most important aspect of PCMCIA is as a prompt
for entirely new developments, particularly in applications software
distribution. Companies such as Lotus Development Corp have already ported
its 1-2-3 spreadsheet to this format with success, where the application
code is held in ROM together with RAM chips for the data the application
generates.
Mr Reimer expects many other applications providers to follow Lotus' lead,
especially as its joint effort with Hewlett-Packard in the development of
the HP95LX palmtop has led to sales of around 50,000 units per month.
As the latest, Version 2.0, of the PCMCIA standard also includes the
definition of other input/output capabilities, the potential opens up for
combining memory with other functionality.
At present, cards offering fax/modem and local area network capabilities are
under development, but as Mr Reimer says, 'developers are limited only by
their imagination in what they can now produce with PCMCIA technology.'
One of its most interesting advantages stems directly from its exploitation
of semiconductor technology - 'we are reaching a point where the data held
in a card memory is worth more than the cost of the system that generated
it,' says Mr Reimer. 'Because of the technology, these cards can withstand a
500g drop and still function. A palmtop or pen computer can easily be
dropped, breaking the machine and losing the data. With PCMCIA cards, that
data can be recovered by putting the card in a new machine.'

   Saatchi Unloads Peterson Consulting Unit

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., determined to rid itself of its
consulting businesses at any cost, dumped its Peterson
Consulting unit -- for which it paid $116 million -- for less
than $20 million.
   Saatchi said it agreed to sell Chicago-based Peterson to
the consulting firm's management for an initial payment of
just $2 million, with additional payments over the next 10
years of at least $20 million. Saatchi will also take on
Peterson liabilities with a net total of $5 million --
meaning that initially, at least, it will in effect be paying
Peterson to buy itself back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They're giving Peterson $3 million {upfront} to take it.
I don't understand the logic," says Richard Sanderson, an
analyst with Panmure Gordon in London. "They're actually
giving it away."
   A Saatchi spokesman readily conceded that the agency won't
come close to realizing its investment in Peterson, and that
the agency is basically just cutting its losses. Peterson "is
a poor, underperforming, loss-making business, and all we're
interested in is getting out at whatever cost it takes -- and
that is plus or minus zero," he said. Peterson was profitable
for the year ended Sept. 30, 1989, but for the six months
ended March 31, 1990, it had a loss of #4 million ($6.92
million).
   Saatchi stock barely reacted to the news, with the
company's American depositary receipts closing off 12.5 cents
to close at $4.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday. Saatchi shares have already been
hammered, reflecting analysts' low expectations; ADRs now
trade at less than a quarter of their 52-week high of $17.25.
   The paltry take for Peterson, bought in 1987, "wasn't a
surprise," says Laurie Goldberger, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton. The price doesn't matter that much because
"you don't quite care how {the consulting business} goes
away; they've achieved the benefit of getting rid of the
downside."
   The sale of Peterson, along with that of Saatchi's other
consulting firms, has been complicated by the fact that the
firms' major assets are their executives. Saatchi has been
negotiating management buy-outs with the consulting
executives, who hold all the cards because they know their
businesses have no value without them.
   "The problem is that these are boutique businesses. If
Peterson's principals leave, then what are you left with? Air
-- and some liabilities," says Greg Ostroff, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs. "I was under the impression Saatchi was just
looking to get out without any more liabilities."
   Peterson executives were obviously well aware of their
clout. In a statement, Saatchi said it agreed to the
unfavorable deal because it couldn't find an outside buyer
and because Peterson senior management's contracts expire at
the end of this year. If Saatchi didn't sell to management,
Saatchi "might well find that the business ceased to be
viable" at year end, the company said. Shutdown costs would
be "substantial," it added. Peterson executives declined
comment.
   The Peterson agreement, which requires shareholder
approval, comes just a few weeks after Saatchi finally agreed
to sell its biggest consulting firm, Hay Group, back to
management. A deal to sell its largest remaining consulting
firm, Gartner Group, is expected to be set in the next few
weeks. Saatchi also owns three other, small consulting
businesses, but two of them -- an employment agency in the
U.K. and a real estate consulting firm in the U.S. -- are
facing economic downturns in their industries. The Saatchi
spokesman said sales of both of those are "on a back burner."
   Saatchi has said recently that it expects proceeds of all
its consulting firms to total #80 million for the year ending
Sept. 30. The Hay sale amounts to #45 million to #50 million.
But Mr. Ostroff says the total figure may be elusive,
considering the prices Saatchi is eking out in its consulting
firesale, and that Saatchi "will probably come up short."
   Still, analysts depict the sale as a mark in favor of
Saatchi's new chief executive officer, Robert Louis-Dreyfus.
When he joined in January, the French executive vowed to get
out of the consulting business as quickly as possible -- a
feat Saatchi had been unable to accomplish since putting the
consulting business up for sale last year.
   "It's a business they shouldn't have been in, and now
they're out," says Alan Gottesman, an analyst with
PaineWebber. "It's quite an accomplishment to be done with
the deal."

   Babbit &amp; Reiman Gets `Us'
                                                                                                       

   Straight Arrow Publishers awarded its $1 million Us
Magazine account to Babbit &amp; Reiman, Atlanta.
   Babbit &amp; Reiman replaces Minneapolis agency Fallon
McElligott, which continues to handle Straight Arrow's
Rolling Stone magazine. Us decided to look elsewhere about a
month ago, "when we couldn't seem to agree on a creative
approach," said Leslie H. Zeifman, group publisher.
   "We had given Babbit &amp; Reiman a two-week window of
opportunity to prove that they would deliver a tremendous
campaign, and they did," Mr. Zeifman said.
   Fallon McElligott had created the magazine's "Definitely
Not Us" ads, which sought to peg Us somewhere between People
and Vanity Fair, even as critics claimed Us's readership was
getting more downscale.
   The account is another in a string of wins for
four-year-old Babbit &amp; Reiman. The agency won the $1.5
million USA Today account in January, and has also garnered
Financial News Network and RJR Nabisco's corporate account.

FT  23 JUL 94 / Arts: Witness to a cool Shavian triumph - Saint Joan, George
Bernard Shaw's powerful drama
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Saint Joan George Bernard Shaw wrote a play that requires a charismatic
heroine, but plugs her in only at certain points. It is not, strictly
speaking, a star vehicle, and if played like one it usually founders; Shaw
had other fish to fry.
At the Strand Theatre, the director Gale Edwards (Australian, female) has
got the balance exactly right. It stirs mind and heart alike, and if you
have intelligent teenage children you should take them along to be stirred
as well. Few modern 'classics' command our thoughtful sympathies like Saint
Joan, and still fewer productions do them such faithful justice.
The play is not really about 'Jeanne la Pucelle', but about the
almost-accidental role she played in a larger, much tougher world of
politics and religion, of which she understood nothing.
In fact Saint Joan represents a disillusioned, retrospective, 1920s view of
History as Realpolitik. The heroine is there to fascinate us, but the heart
of the drama - and it is drama, not just Shavian sparring - lies in the
different ways she is perceived and used by the political masters, both the
French (Burgundian) and the English.
All Joan has to do is to be, while the real action stretches out around and
beyond her. In the small person of Imogen Stubbs, she is a marvel of
bright-eyed energy, from her first bounding entrance. Distinctly elfin, in
fact, with balletic touches, and much more gamine than gamin; one remembered
Joan Plowright's homely, no-nonsense activist (a long way back]) with some
nostalgia.
But Miss Stubbs wields a big, tremulous voice with the best of them, and
regularly catches us between the ribs.
Perhaps she could measure a greater distance between eager optimism at the
start, and weary desolation at the end.
Those Audrey Hepburn eyes do not change much, and there was an awkward
moment when she collapsed to the floor in despair, too obviously confident
of succour by strong arms - which she duly got. As a butterfly broken on a
wheel, nevertheless, she is a radiant creature.
The production has stark sets by Peter J. Davison, basically vertical slabs
that just once open out to give us a fine side-chapel view of the Dauphin's
coronation in Reims Cathedral.
(Reims, by the way, is sometimes Reims and sometimes 'Reems', even in the
mouths of different French personnel.) That is all to the good: picturesque
ramparts are not what the play needs. What it chiefly needs is a solid team
of politicos, both temporal and spiritual; and these Miss Edwards has
supplied in full measure.
Faced with pages of Shavian debate, many a director equips his or her actors
with a rich variety of tics to sugar the pill. Not Miss Edwards; instead,
she makes the debates supply the characters - the variously foxy or
temporising Frenchmen, the blunt or choleric English.
We listen hard. I particularly admired Bruce Purchase's virtuosity with the
Archbishop's speeches, which he rattles off quite lucidly at high speed,
thus saving vital minutes. There is a good Dunois from Philip Quast, and a
properly sullen Cauchon from Paul Webster.
Highest praise, though, for Peter Jeffrey's Inquisitor and Ken Bones' Earl
of Warwick, both of them revelling in pawky subtleties. Jeffrey is a gentle
model of temperate, deadly reasonableness; Bones - with a startling likeness
to Norman Tebbit - plays Warwick with an air of cheerful ruthlessness,
letting his weary, cynical intelligence peep through as the situation
develops. There is just a trace of pain, and distaste, when the execution
has to be got through.
Jasper Britton's artful Dauphin supplies more than comic relief. There is a
twitch or two too many, but his petulance is genuine and sour.
As young Brother Martin, appalled at seeing the trap close, Nicholas Rowe
conveys strength as well as a tender heart. In the epilogue, Gordon Langford
Rowe is splendidly unbuttoned as the plain English Soldier. Among others too
numerous to mention, there is no weak link.
As Warwick's testy chaplain, de Stogumber, David Daker for once makes the
real voice of Bernard Shaw heard. A plain, thick Englishman, he fulminates
and blusters vengefully, but when the chips go down he is overcome with
simple horror.
In his empirical English way, he needs to see what a burning at the stake
means; but having seen it, his revulsion is absolute.
A real vegetarian's argument, that: amid all the thrust and counter-thrust
which Shaw mimics with such relish, this is where the stopper comes, the
final NO. Shaw was not a cynic.

<TEXT>
   High winds and dry tinder fueled a fire
that was burning uncontrolled Sunday night in the Black Hills
National Forest, authorities said.
   ``It is a very large fire,'' said Dick Hawthorne, a dispatcher
at the U.S. Forest Service's Pactola office. ``At one time one of
our fellows called in and said it was about a mile long.''
   The fire was 60 percent contained by fire breaks Sunday evening
after burning an estimated 350 acres, said Forest Service
spokeswoman Dianne Reimers. Winds were expected to kick up again
Monday, but officials did not expect the fire to get much larger,
Ms. Reimers said.
   About 140 firefighters were working to contain the blaze, which
they hoped to have under control by Monday afternoon, she said.
   No one had been evacuated, she said.
   Earlier Sunday, when the Forest Service measured winds at 40 mph
and gusts at 50-60 mph, Hawthorne said about a dozen homes along
Sheridan Lake Road southwest of Rapid City were being monitored.
   Temperatures reached 80 degrees around noon in the Rapid City
area Sunday before a cold front came through and dropped readings
to 50 degrees by 3 p.m.
   The fire-danger index for all of South Dakota was rated
``extreme'' Sunday because of high temperatures, winds and low
relative humidity readings, the National Weather Service said.

9 STATE ATTRACTIONS, DELTA JOIN TO LURE VISITORS; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: THE AIRLINE WILL GIVE FREE TICKETS TO DISNEYLAND, UNIVERSAL AND OTHER 
LOCATIONS TO CERTAIN CALIFORNIA-BOUND FLIERS. 
</P>

<P>
Nine of California's major tourist attractions have joined forces with the 
state Department of Commerce and Delta Air Lines in what tourism officials on 
Thursday described as an unprecedented campaign to bolster the state's meager 
share of tourists from Eastern states. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry officials also hope that the campaign -- scheduled to begin 
Jan. 1 -- will revive gate receipts that have declined in the past year because 
of a nationwide economic slowdown, fear of gangs and the threat of war in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The state has dedicated $180,000 of its $7-million annual tourism advertising 
budget to help promote the "Delta California Dream Vacation" package, in which 
the Atlanta-based carrier will offer California-bound passengers free admission 
tickets to the state's major tourist attractions under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland, Universal Studios and the San Diego Zoo are among the tourist 
attractions contributing $25,000 each to the advertising campaign, in addition 
to providing Delta with admission tickets at a "deep, deep discount," said Jack 
Stewart, the Commerce Department's chief deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
The promotional campaign could generate as much as $25 million in additional 
tourist spending if Delta reaches its goal of selling 25,000 travel packages to 
tourists in the East, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, he said, Delta's television and newspaper advertising 
campaign in major Eastern markets should leave "countless impressions" on 
consumers who traditionally have flown or driven to Florida rather than 
traveled to California for family vacations. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of exposure is important, tourism experts said, because the state 
spends woefully little on out-of-state promotion, and individual tourist 
attractions lack the capital to heavily advertise their attractions back East. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has ever done anything like this before," Stewart said. "We're going 
head-to-head with Florida" for Eastern tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
During 1991, Delta will offer the free tickets, which would carry a value of 
more than $500 to a family of four, to passengers who book certain round-trip 
flights, agree to rent a car and remain in California for at least five days, 
Stewart said. The package is available to residents of all states except 
California, Nevada and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Other tourist attractions participating are the Queen Mary and Spruce Goose, 
the San Diego Wild Animal Park, Knotts Berry Farm, Sea World of California, 
Marine World Africa USA Theme Park and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
Industry and state tourism officials have for years known that California ranks 
far behind Florida as a destination for Eastern tourists. During 1989, for 
example, tourists from states east of the Rocky Mountains accounted for just 
25% of the nearly $50 billion of tourism-related spending in California. The 
remainder was spent by Californians and residents of 10 Western states. 
</P>
<P>
Delta declined to specify how much it would spend on the campaign, but Stewart 
said Delta has agreed to spend "a figure that is between $3 million and $5 
million" on the promotion and the purchase of admission tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Delta outbid United Airlines, American Airlines and USAir for the right to the 
California vacation promotion, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Delta spokeswoman Frances Conner said the airline pursued the promotion to 
bolster its share of the lucrative East-West air traffic market. 
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation (for the Delta campaign) is unprecedented," San Diego Zoo 
spokesman Jeff Jouett said. "We've never been all together like this before, 
and the state deserves praise. I think it's really a sign of the times; we're 
all seeing (attendance) decreases in Southern California, so we're trying to 
combine forces and get people here." 
</P>
<P>
"It comes down to a common cause, a common interest," Disneyland spokesman Bob 
Roth said. "We've done some joint efforts previously (with Knotts Berry Farm) 
but nothing on this broad a spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry experts said they would hope to recoup the cost of the ticket 
giveaways through sales of "T-shirts, food, souvenirs and the like," Stewart 
said. In addition to money spent at the attractions, hotels and restaurants 
would also get some of the tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to the parks will not be as dramatic as it first appears because 
"nobody could have the energy to do all nine parks," said Harrison Price, a 
Torrance-based tourism industry consultant. "Whoever priced it (for the parks) 
has contemplated the fact that not all the (free admissions) will be used." 
</P>
<P>
Price commended the state for getting the nine attractions to agree to a joint 
campaign. "Over the years I've seen a ton of joint-marketing efforts where a 
couple of different parks might get together," Price said. "But this is the 
biggest group I've ever seen together." 
</P>
<P>
Although the parks are working together to get Easterners into the state, "once 
the tourists are in California, it's everyone for himself again," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said it is too soon to say if the program will be repeated during 1992.

FT  11 JUL 92 / Motoring: The fast way across France (for lorries too)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOOD news is that with the opening of the A26 autoroute extension
between Chalons-sur-Marne and Troyes on June 30, one can now drive from
Calais to the Mediterranean without seeing a single traffic light.
The bad news is that if you tried to do so last week, you would have been
stuck in the world's biggest jam, courtesy of anarchic French farmers and
lorry drivers.
My wife and I were lucky. Invited to attend the official opening, we drove
off Sealink Stena's Invicta at Calais and pointed the Audi 100 tdi east. Two
and a half hours and 172 miles (270 kms) later we had parked at Hotel Les
Consuls in Reims.
Over dinner at Le Vigneron (a mere two knives and forks in Michelin does it
less than justice) Didier Kreig, of Champagne-Ardennes comite de tourisme,
suggested that we await events in the morning. The opening ceremony was off.
With sang froid a stiff upper-lipped Englishman would have been proud of,
Didier proposed a drive to Epernay, a helicopter flight over the vineyards
and, naturally, lunch.
Later, when we reached the start of the new autoroute just north of Chalons,
there was not a single farm tractor or lorry in sight - and virtually no
other traffic, either. It was tempting to cruise the ultra long-legged Audi
diesel at the 100 mph (161 kmh) and more it was clearly designed for. The
new 47 mile (75 km) section links the A4 autoroute 16 miles (26 kms) south
east of Reims with the A5 near Royes. From there it is 93 miles/150 kms to
Dijon and another 118 miles/190 kms to Lyon by the A6 via Beaune.
Unlike British motorways, which seem to be open for years before service
areas are built, the SANEF company operating the A26 made sure that by June
30 a filling station, shop and restaurant, the Sommesous aire de service at
half distance, with everything a traveller could need, from showers and a
sauna to coin-operated fax machines, were all up and running.
Drivers traveling from Calais to southern or eastern France or to
Switzerland will not have to go near Paris and the dreaded peripherique
again. Instead, they should try breaking their journey at the ancient city
of Troyes. Parking may not be easy, but it is worth a visit.

<TEXT>
   The Army wants to find the next of kin for six
crewmen who died when their B-17 was lost on a 1942 patrol over the
Coral Sea, officials said Tuesday.
   Although the aircraft was found and the crew list confirmed
after several research missions to Papua, New Guinea, in 1986 and
1987, relatives of six of the eight crewmen haven't been found,
said Shari Lawrence, spokeswoman for the U.S. Total Army Personnel
Command.
   ``The many years since the incident have made the locations
difficult,'' she said in a statement.
   The plane disappeared after leaving from Townsville in
Queensland, Australia. The Army believes the crew encountered the
enemy because the Battle of the Coral Sea occurred in the days
immediately after its disappearance, the statement said.
   The six unidentified crewmen are:
   _2nd Lt. Jim Sam Grant, born Jan. 28, 1918. Last known next of
kin: father Walter C. Grant, Malvern, Ark., and mother Marian P.
Grant, Tuscon, Ariz.
   _2nd Lt. Robert R. Meyer, Jr., birthdate unknown. Last known
next of kin was father Robert R. Meyer, Birmingham, Ala.
   _Staff Sgt. Elton J. Rose, birthdate unknown. Last known next of
kin was wife Gladys Strickland Rose, Coleman, Texas.
   _Sgt. Joe A. Carter, born May 10, 1910. Last known next of kin
was mother Hazel Williams, La Jolla, Calif.
   _Sgt. Edward L. Hargrove, birthdate unknown. Last known next of
kin were wife Evelyn W. Hargrove, Albuquerque, N.M., and
grandfather, Manuel E. Flores, El Centro, Calif.
   _Sgt. Paul Reimer, born June 21, 1918. Last known next of kin
was mother Eva Reimer, Reedley, Calif.

<LEADPARA>  The A's paid their respects Tuesday night at the shrine to Nolan Ryan. The
rest of the ascending Texas Rangers made the A's pay their dues.;    Ryan
started, but didn't figure in the decision. The Rangers with the bats figured
heavily, burying the A's with 19 hits on the way to winning 9-6.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  RANGERS, WEAK PITCHING BURY A'S  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The result dropped the sinking A's, who've lost 12 of the last 16, into
fifth place in American League West for the first time since May 18, 1987.;   
What could have been an uplifting victory turned into a crushing loss. Despite
mustering only four hits in the game, the A's came back from five runs down
and tied the score 6-6. They even had two Rangers out with the bases empty
before Texas struck for its winning three runs in the eighth.;    Rick
Honeycutt, the third of four A's pitchers, surrendered a single to Julio
Franco after getting those first two outs.;    When the Rangers sent
right-handed pinch hitter Brian Downing to the plate, A's Manager Tony La
Russa replaced the left-handed Honeycutt with Gene Nelson in a textbook move.;
   And here's what happened: Franco stole second. Downing walked on four
pitches. Juan Gonzalez was hit in the back with a pitch, loading the bases.
Steve Buechele, who looked silly swinging and missing on two offerings,
bounced a two-run single up the middle on a 1-and-2 count, and Ivan Rodriguez
stroked his fourth hit of the game for the third run.;    "I didn't pitch
well," Nelson said after his ERA jumped to 10.59. "I didn't do anything right.
I was just flinging. This has me doubting myself and making me wonder what I'm
doing wrong.";    Half the A's hits went 825 feet. Harold Baines crushed a
Ryan fastball 425 feet for a solo homer in the fourth, the first hit off Ryan.
Jose Canseco followed two walks with his 19th homer in the fifth.;    Both
Canseco and Baines came up as the potential tying run in the ninth. Jeff
Russell, who had walked two, struck out both of them.;    The victory, which
moved third-place Texas to within two games of first, and Ryan were what the
sellout crowd of 41,172 paid to see. They streamed in under the huge portrait
of Ryan that hangs between the American and Texas flags outside the main
entrance.;    Working for the first time since June 21 when his right shoulder
stiffened in a game, Ryan, 44, lasted only the minimum five innings needed to
post his 307th career victory. He didn't get it because reliever Terry Mathews
allowed the tying two runs to score in the seventh.;    Along the way, Ryan
struck out five, including Willie Wilson in the fourth for Ryan's 100th of the
season. That gave Ryan 22 straight seasons of 100 or more strikeouts, a major
league record he formerly shared with Don Sutton. Ryan owns 49 records, either
major, American or National.;    Ryan persevered an inning longer than A's
starter Bob Welch. Dean Palmer and Rafael Palmeiro each drove in three runs
off Welch. Palmer hit a two-run homer in third and Palmeiro crushed the next
pitch into the right-field bleachers.;    It was Palmeiro's turn to hit a
two-run homer in the fourth after Palmer had driven in a run with an infield
single.;  HOW THEY SCORED;    Rangers 3rd -- With one out, Huson singled.
Huson stole second. Palmer homered. Palmeiro homered. Rangers 3, A's 0.;   
A's 4th -- With one out, Baines homered. Rangers 3, A's 1.;    Rangers 4th --
Buechele singled. Buechele caught stealing, but is safe on shortstop Riles'
fielding error. Rodriguez singled, moving Buechele to third. Huson lined into
double play. Palmer singled, scoring Buechele. Palmeiro homered. Rangers 6,
A's 1.;    A's 5th -- With one out, Gallego walked. R.Henderson walked, moving
Gallego to second. With two out, Canseco homered. Rangers 6, A's 4.;    A's
7th -- Gallego walked. R.Henderson doubled, scoring Gallego. Riles grounded
out, moving R.Henderson to third. Canseco grounded out, scoring R.Henderson.

singled. Downing pinch hit for Reimer. Nelson pitching. Franco stole second.
Downing walked. Gonzalez hit by pitch, moving Franco to third and Downing to

<LEADPARA>  Chili Davis and Shane Mack each got three of Minnesota's 18 hits and the Twins
routed the Boston Red Sox 14-1 Sunday for their first four-game sweep at
Fenway Park since 1981.;    Kirby Puckett drove in three runs with two singles
in Minnesota's highest-scoring game of the season. Every Twins starter had a

<TEXT>     The Twins outscored Boston 33-6 in the series, and they won for the eighth
time in 10 games since the All-Star break.;    The Red Sox have lost eight of
11 since the break, including seven of eight against Minnesota.;    The Red
Sox became so desperate for pitchers that they used utilityman Steve Lyons in
the ninth. Lyons allowed two hits and struck out one in his second major
league pitching appearance.;    "I think we're all embarrassed," Lyons said.
"I think there's a difference from being embarrassed when you go out and don't
care and when you go out and come up short. At this point, I think you have to
look in the mirror and play with a little more pride.";  RANGERS 6, BLUE JAYS
5: Kevin Reimer's two-run pinch homer rallied Texas over Toronto in Arlington,
Texas.;    Reimer, batting for designated hitter Brian Downing in the seventh
inning, hit his fifth homer to give Texas a split of the four-game series.; 
INDIANS 5, ANGELS 2: In Anaheim, Glenallen Hill and Albert Belle hit two-run
homers as Cleveland toppled California and starting pitcher Mark Langston, who
gave up five runs in six innings.;  MARINERS 6, ORIOLES 4: Ken Griffey Jr. and
Alvin Davis homered in a five-run fifth inning that powered Seattle past host
Baltimore.;    Down 4-1 after four innings, the Mariners bounced back to
record their 20th come-from-behind victory of the season.;  ROYALS 8, TIGERS
4: Kurt Stillwell broke a 3-3 tie with a two-run homer, and Kansas City hung
on to beat Detroit in Kansas City, Mo.;  BREWERS 2, WHITE SOX 1: Greg Vaughn
homered, singled and scored the go-ahead run in the seventh inning as
Milwaukee won in Chicago.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Q  My husband and I visited Farwell's Rhododendron Nursery in Woodside. Each
plant there is marked by name, no prices. One of the owner's grandsons told us
the plants we were interested in were $90 each. We paid for one by check and
put a second on hold. When we returned the next weekend for it, we were
greeted by the owner, who told us her grandson had given us the wrong price
and we owed her $35 more for the first plant. She told us to pay it or bring
the plant back. We paid it -- plus tax. But we told her we felt upset at the
way she handled the situation and we didn't want the plant we'd put on hold.
What happened to customer service? Can we do anything about this?;    --

<TEXT>  A  Sorry. Nursery owner Margery Farwell stands her ground. She says her
grandson erred in quoting the price but says $90 is below cost, and she would
lose money if she let the sale stand. She says this type of misunderstanding
has occurred "many times" before but the prices of the plants are posted on
sticks located in each flower bed. She says she didn't force you to pay $35
more; she offered your husband a $90 plant in exchange for the one you took
home. We checked with the San Mateo County District Attorney's office, where
an attorney says consumer law doesn't really cover the situation you describe
and it would be considered a civil dispute best resolved in small claims
court. However, he adds that, ethically, consumers should expect to have
completed their sales transactions once they leave a store or business. The
District Attorney's Consumer Fraud Unit is interested in mediating the
dispute. Contact the unit at 401 Marshall St., Redwood City 94063, (415)
363-4651.; REMINISCE THROUGH THE MAIL; Q  After receiving a sample copy, I
subscribed in April to Reminisce, a magazine mostly about the '30s and '40s.
It was supposed to be new. No issues have arrived yet. Foolishly, I did not
keep the address, and someone threw the sample copy away.;    -- O.M., San
Jose; A  Get ready to reminisce: Your first issue is scheduled to begin this
month. Reiman Publications, the publisher, entered your order May 21, and it
usually takes another four to six weeks for the subscription to start, says a
customer service representative. Reminisce comes out every two months and is
sent by third-class mail. We confirmed that Reiman has your correct address.
If you haven't received the magazine by the time you read this, you should
contact Reiman directly at (800) 344-6913. Incidentally, it's always a good
idea to write down the magazine's address on your check. We found Reminisce
through the public library. Another source is the Magazine Publishers
Association, (212) 752-0055. The association has the following hints for
consumers with magazine problems:;    (check)  Write to "subscription manager"
at the subscriptions address on the masthead. Include an address label and
proof of payment. Follow this letter with one to the circulation director at
the corporate headquarters address, also on the masthead.;    (check)  For
problems with door-to-door or telephone solicitations, write the manager of
the company shown on your receipt or contract. File complaints with the Better
Business Bureau or chamber of commerce in the city in which the company is
located.;    (check)  For magazines you didn't order, return the bill in the
envelope it came in. Write "Return -- Did not order" on the envelope. If you
accepted a free sample copy of a magazine and did not to continue the
subscription, return the bill in a stamped envelope with a note saying you
wish to cancel.; S&amp;H STAMPS STILL WORTH A LICK; Q  I would like to know if the
Sperry and Hutchinson Co. (S&amp;H Green Stamps) is still in business. I mailed
some books of stamps to be redeemed to a post office box in Ohio. The stamps
were returned to me with the envelope stamped "address unknown." If there's a
new address, I'd be grateful for that information.;    -- Christine Phillips,
San Jose; A  S&amp;H Green Stamps hasn't used that Ohio address for years, says a
spokeswoman. Although there are no more S&amp;H Green Stamps redemption centers in
California, you can redeem your books for cash or merchandise. A variety of
stores in the state still distribute the stamps, the spokeswoman says. Contact
the company for information and a catalog by calling (800) 874-4438 or writing
Mail Order Center, Box 5775, Norcross, Ga. 30091. The cash value of a book of
stamps is $1.20, says a company spokeswoman. She also says you can purchase
additional books at $2.50 each to use toward purchasing merchandise in the
catalog.; CANES AND WALKERS NEEDED; S  t. James Senior Center is seeking
donations of canes and walkers to distribute to needy seniors. Many seniors
need devices either temporarily, permanently or as replacements for worn or
broken devices. Citizens with donations should call (408) 277-4194.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Rafael Palmeiro, one of the three Texas Rangers to get a hit Wednesday night,
said it all about Dave Stewart.;    "He was the Stewart of old," Palmeiro
said. "He went after the hitters. If he pitches like that every game, he'll
win every game."  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  STEWART STYMIES TEXAS
HE RETURNS TO FORM WITH 3-HIT SHUTOUT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Old Dave put it all together at Arlington Stadium in pitching the A's past
the Rangers 5-0.;    Stewart walked only two in facing just 32 batters in his
first shutout and first complete game of the season.;    No Ranger got as far
as third base. And no more than one reached base at one time until Ruben
Sierra singled and Julio Franco walked with two out in the ninth.;    Pitching
coach Dave Duncan walked out to the mound to tell Stewart to relax. Stewart
may have thought he had been told to throw forkballs to left-handed
designated-hitter Kevin Reimer.;    Well, the first pitch was a fastball that
missed. The next four were all dipping forkballs. The three that were strikes
were missed by Reimer like a man trying to bat in a tight skirt and a girdle.;
   "Yeah, I know they got 19 hits last night," Stewart said. "This was a
different night. When I'm right, I'm capable of beating anyone.";    Stewart's
problem was that he has been wrong most of this season. He has won two in a
row, lifting his record to 6-4. But he hadn't won in his four previous starts,
including a 6-1 bashing by the Rangers eight days earlier in Oakland.;    "I
wasn't using the forkball enough," Stewart said. "When I've got the forkball,
they can't sit on the fastball.";    Whatever the cause of Stewart's struggles
wasn't apparent this time. Palmeiro doubled in the first when Willie Wilson
couldn't negotiate the rain-soaked area in left field. Palmeiro walked in the
sixth. Franco singled in the fourth. Other than the ninth inning, nothing for
the Rangers.;    "Stew can get on a roll and carry a team," second baseman
Mike Gallego said. "We expect that out of him.";    Stewart told some of his
teammates before the game that they didn't have to get him any runs "because
I'm going to hold up my end this time.";    They got him runs anyway. In the
fifth inning, Mike Bordick doubled home Gallego and with two out, Jose Canseco
doubled home Rickey Henderson. That was enough for Stewart and enough to pin
the loss on left-hander John Barfield.;    But the A's weren't through.
Gallego led off the seventh with a 356-foot homer. With two out, Canseco
connected for a two-run homer, his 20th, victimizing Calvin Schiraldi. Canseco
has hit at least 20 homers in five seasons.;    Canseco's 411-footer continued
his tear. His last 16 hits are five doubles, seven homers and four singles.;  
 "My homer was longer than Josie's," Gallego said. "Josie even told me so.";  
 Canseco walked by and pointed a finger at Gallego.;    "Image," Canseco said.
"It's all image. But don't forget, sometimes image can hurt you. Hey, but you
got it all. Mine was off the end of the bat."; ETC.: A's Manager Tony La Russa
said after the game that the A's were not interested in first baseman Greg
Brock, released earlier in the day by the Milwaukee Brewers. . . . Left-handed
relief pitcher Joe Klink is scheduled to begin rehabilitation from a broken
right foot tonight when he pitches in a game for Class A Modesto at Reno.
Klink also will pitch Saturday and Monday with the idea of having him return
to Oakland after the All-Star Game.; HOW THEY SCORED;    A's 5th -- With one
out, Gallego singled. Bordick doubled, scoring Gallego. R.Henderson was safe
on shortstop Huson's fielding error. Wilson grounded into fielder's choice,
forcing Bordick at third and moving R.Henderson to second. Canseco doubled,
scoring R.Henderson. A's 2, Rangers 0.;    A's 7th -- Gallego homered. With
two out, Wilson safe on second baseman Franco's fielding error. Schiraldi
pitching. Wilson stole second. Canseco homered. A's 5, Rangers 0.; OAKLAND

<TEXT>
   Six youngsters who scrounged for two weeks
for a place to live after being abandoned by a drug addict mother
have been split up among foster homes and friends, according to
authorities, who want to reunite them.
   ``Anytime we can help a family, we certainly will go the extra
yard to try to do that,'' said Norman Reim, a spokesman for the
state Division of Youth and Family Services. ``The goal is to get
them in a permanent home.''
   The six _ four children ages 11 to 16, two with children of their
own _ told police they wandered for a place to live after their
37-year-old mother left them.
   ``They was going from building to building, door to door,'' said
32-year-old Gabriel Rosa, the oldest daughter's boyfriend and father
of her 2-month-old son, who took the family into his one-bedroom
apartment. ``That's a shame.''
   The Camden Housing Authority had threatened to evict Rosa because
the youngsters were unauthorized to live in the apartment, he said.
   Not knowing what to do, the children called police.
   Detectives took the children to police headquarters. After
meeting Tuesday with a social worker, the family was separated.
   ``It's bad for kids to be without a home and struggling from
house to house,'' said Reim, who declined to comment specifically
about the case. ``Certainly, in this business, we've seen it all.''
   Thirteen-year-old Cassandra Wilson and her brother, James Wilson,
11, were placed in foster homes. Rosa's girlfriend, Joanne Victor,
16, and their son moved in with him. Patricia Wilson and her
7-week-old son moved in with friends at the housing project.
   Police searched for the family's mother, Sandra Wilson. The
children said their troubles began about two years ago when their
mother started smoking cocaine.
   Although the family's house was heavily damaged in a June fire,
the family continued to live there, using candles and kerosene
heaters. But after the gas was shut off for non-payment in November,
the youngsters moved out.
   They said their mother left them at the end of November, taking
her welfare check. Three days later, they said, she came back and
took $405 in cash from the family and left again.

Texas (Kevin Brown 5-5) at Oakland (Mike Moore 8-6), 7:05 p.m. Radio: KSFO

<TEXT>     But unlike his previous performances, there was no cushion for Stewart to
work with Tuesday night.;    Instead, his misfortunes continued as Texas beat
Stewart and the A's 6-1 in the first game of a seven-game homestand before
37,195 bundled-up fans at the Coliseum.;    It was Stewart's first loss at
home this season. The A's had won all nine of his previous Coliseum starts.;  
 "Six, six, six. Isn't that the sign of the devil?" Stewart deadpanned.;    It
was the only thing Stewart (4-4) could joke about.;    The loss dropped the
A's into a second-place tie with California in the American League West, 4 1/2
games behind Minnesota.;    Stewart's miseries continued, as he allowed six
earned runs and 10 hits in seven innings against the league's second-best
hitting team.;    He continues to be haunted by big rallies. The Rangers
scored three runs in the third and put the game out of reach on Juan
Gonzalez's three-run home run with two out in the seventh.;    Stewart has
allowed at least three runs in an inning in each of his past five starts, a
fact not lost on him.;    "That's the frustrating part," Stewart said. "It's
the cost of the mistake. During a game you're going to make some mistakes. But
these have been costly.;    "I'm feeling some frustration. Not depression, but
frustration is settling in. I'm starting to dream about six (runs) a night."; 
  A's Manager Tony La Russa downplayed Stewart's performance, pointing to the
lack of offensive support. True, the A's had averaged nearly 6.5 runs in
Stewart's first 13 starts. But his pitching totals have become difficult to
overcome.;    In his past six starts, Stewart has allowed 32 earned runs in 40
1/3 innings. He's allowed 58 earned runs this season, the most in the American
League. His ERA is 5.89.;    "He's struggling now, but he can't give in," La
Russa said. "He's got to make it work. (Texas) had three runs going into the
seventh.";    The Rangers could have scored more. A double play kept Texas
from scoring more runs in the third, and Rickey Henderson's diving catch in
left-center with runners at first and third ended a rally in the fourth.;   
It caught up to Stewart in the seventh, when Gonzalez tagged a hanging
breaking ball over the center-field fence to give the Rangers a 6-1 lead.;   
Stewart said he paid the price in the third inning for a hanging forkball that
Kevin Reimer looped down the left-field line for a two-run single.;    "I just
wanted to put the ball in play," Reimer said.;    Stewart, under La Russa's
three-man rotation until the All-Star break, is scheduled to pitch Saturday.
But La Russa said he would check with Stewart today before making a final
decision.;    Tuesday night, the A's couldn't muster much offense against Jose
Guzman (2-3). They managed seven hits but didn't put a leadoff man on base in
eight of those innings.;    They scratched a run in the third, thanks to the
bottom of the order. Mike Gallego singled to right and scored on Lance
Blankenship's first-pitch double.;    Rickey Henderson drew a walk, but the
rally bogged down when Dave Henderson took a called third strike and Jose
Canseco and Harold Baines hit into force-outs at second.;  HOW THEY SCORED;   
Rangers 3rd -- Downing singled and Palmeiro walked. With one out, Franco
singled, scoring Downing and moving Palmeiro to third. Franco stole second.
Reimer singled, scoring Palmeiro and Franco. Rangers 3, A's 0.;    A's 3rd --
Gallego singled and scored on Blankenship's double. Rangers 3, A's 1.;

FT  02 JAN 93 / Motoring: Bargains beckon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL and EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROSS-Channel ferry operators, notably Stena Sealink, are already carrying
extra travellers eager to buy cheap drink in France, writes Stuart Marshall.
From yesterday, weight and space are the only practical limits on what a
motorist can bring back, local duty paid, from France.
No longer will you have to trouble your conscience by tucking an illicit
extra bottle under the seat. Customs' guidelines allow for 90 litres of
wine, 10 litres of spirits, and 110 litres of beer. All you need do is
convince them you are going to drink it all yourself.
Even duty-free allowances are to be doubled - you can bring in what you buy
on both outward and return voyages. The pity is that with Ffr8 to the pound,
not Ffr10, hypermarket wines are not the bargains they were. But lager
(under Pounds 5 for two dozen 25cl bottles) is still cheap.
Stena Sealink, which offers day trip fares starting from Pounds 70 return
for a car with five people, is featuring the Champagne-Ardennes region in
its 1993 short break programme. Two nights' bed and breakfast in Reims will
be about Pounds 80 a person in a two-star hotel and Pounds 120 for a
four-star relais du silence, ferry crossings included.
For a small supplement, visits to champagne cellars, with a tasting, are
included. Reims is a relaxed 2 1/2 -hour (and Ffr170) drive on the uncrowded
A26 autoroute starting in Calais docks.
Edmund Penning-Rowsell writes: In Alice King's book A Bootful of Wine
(Mandarin/Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 4.99, 192 pages) the wine-buying
operation is planned in detail. Be sure to work out the car's payload and
capacity, and how to pack the wine. A VW Golf hatchback with the back seat
down takes 20 cases, a Ford Sierra 10 in the boot.
King lists and describes 230 wines likely to be found in French supermarkets
and provides recommended growers' names to be found on the label.
Biggest savings are on sparkling wines: Pounds 1.83 a bottle on duty and
VAT, compared with Pounds 1.11 table wines. Each wine listed is given the
grape variety, its phonetic spelling and price band: inexpensive below
Ffr20, medium-priced Ffr20-70 and expensive more than Ffr70. Buyers at
cellars in wine districts must ensure that the green capsule conge is on the
bottle top, as this alone shows that TVA (VAT) has been paid.

<TEXT>     Groundout, shortstop to first.;   If Franco didn't play another game, Ken
Griffey Jr. or Wade Boggs could finish a robust 15 for 36 in their remaining
nine games and still finish second to him in the American League batting title
race.;   Strikeout. Walk. The title is his to lose, and that's just what
Franco seemed to be doing Friday until he sliced a ninth-inning, RBI double
off Joe Klink in Texas' 3-0 victory over the A's.;   "I've been looking for (a
batting title) my entire career," said Franco, 29. "It's pretty important,
really. I intend to continue what I've been doing.";   By going 1 for 4,
Franco's average dipped only from .341 to .340. Seattle's Griffey went 3 for 6
Friday, raising his from .333 to 334; Boston's Boggs took a .333 to .331
drop.;   Franco claims not to be worrying about Griffey or Boggs. But he is
not sure he has a lock on his title.;   "We'll see," he said. "Just don't let
me get hot. If I get hot, that's all she wrote.";   He has led the A.L. in
hitting for all but four of the last 33 days. He also has sore hamstring
muscles and has been playing the past two months with a sore right ankle. Add
to that, he was hit in the back last week by teammate Dean Palmer's errant
foul ball.;   "I have to put (the aches and pains) behind my head," he said,
"and do what I've been doing.";   He sat out Thursday's game against the A's,
resting his muscles after games on the artificial turf at Minnesota and
Seattle. He'll sit out more, he said, if it'll help him win.;   He could get
to the point where he would clinch the title by sitting out the final game or
two, preventing his average from falling to a point where it could be caught.;
  "It's been done before, hasn't it?" he said. "Why not?";   Rangers Manager
Bobby Valentine said he doubted Franco has reached a point he can sit on his
lead, or that he actually would, anyway.;   "I think he'll try to win this
aggressively, like he does everything else," Valentine said. "I don't think
it'll be won sitting.";   Franco started off the season slow, hitting .232
over his first 24 games but has hit .363 (167 for 460) since. It's a rarity
when Franco isn't hitting .300. Had he not missed that level by only three
hits last season, this would be his sixth season in a row above .300.;   If he
wins the title, it will be the first by an A.L. second baseman since Rod Carew
in 1975 and only the third by a right-handed hitter in the last 21 years
(Carney Lansford won in 1981 and Kirby Puckett won in 1989).; HOW THEY SCORED;

<TEXT>
   Tired of all those videocassettes cluttering up
your house? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to tape 10 favorite TV
soaps or five or six movies on one cassette?
   How about 30 hours of recording per cassette?
   West German videocassette manufacturer BASF says that by 1991 it
will be offering U.S. viewers a tape with a 10-hour capacity.
   Meanwhile, a Finnish company, Nokia, says it has developed a new
technology allowing a new line of VHS recorders to cram those 10
hours onto a tape without the loss of picture quality that results
when today's VCRs are cranked down to their slowest speeds.
   ``The picture quality is better than existing long-play
systems,'' Nokia spokesman Lauri Kivinen said in a telephone
interview last week.
   Nokia, a major manufacturer of television sets in Europe, hopes
to license its new technology to VCR manufacturers and the new
recorders could be on the market sometime in 1990, Kivinen said.
   The BASF tape will be usable on existing videocassette recorders.
BASF will use a superstrong, thin polyester film to pile more tape
into each videocassette, according to the Sept. 11 issue of TV
Digest, which reviewed the new Nokia and BASF products at the Berlin
Audio-Visual Fair.
   The BASF cassette will allow up to 15 hours of taping on VCRs
with a European system that uses a slower speed than U.S.
videocassette recorders.
   U.S. VCRs provide two hours of recording at normal speed on a
standard cassette. American VCRs also have a half-speed, long-play
mode that allows four hours of recording, and a one-third,
extended-play speed that allows six hours of recording.
   The higher the taping speed, the better the image quality.
   Nokia says it has found a way to record at a speed equivalent to
the extended-play mode while maintaining image quality that is
better than long-play mode.
   Kivinen said Nokia hopes its system will become the new standard
for VCRs. TV Digest quoted the system's inventor, Nokia engineer
Gerd Reime, as saying that although no tests have been conducted, 30
hours of taping may be possible using his new technology.
   Reime said the new circuitry could cost as little as $3 to
incorporate into new VCRs.
   BASF has been testing its new super long-play tape for about a
year and will introduce it in Europe this fall, according to Tom
Neidhart, director of marketing at BASF's information systems
division in Bedford, Mass.
   ``By 1991 we expect to offer the 10-hour tape in the U.S.,''
Neidhart said.
   BASF already markets a videocassette in the United States that
allows eight hours of taping at slow speed. But the tape has
captured only a small percentage of the blank videocassette market,
which is approaching 300 million units in annual sales, Neidhart
said.
   BASF launched a national television ad campaign last month to try
to boost sales for the eight-hour tape.
   ``We know from research that most people would like to use a
longer tape for some or all of their recording purposes,'' Neidhart
said, noting that it means viewers won't run out of tape too soon
and that the tapes will take up less space in their video libraries.

<LEADPARA>  Mike Moore had pitched 5 1/3 shutout innings when A's Manager Tony La Russa
came to get him Wednesday night.;    Even though Moore had been near perfect,
allowing a hit and walking two, the move made sense. When Moore has hung
around longer in games this month, he usually has run into trouble. But it
didn't matter, because the A's fell apart after Moore left, blowing Moore's
1-0 lead and losing 8-1 to the Texas Rangers at the Coliseum.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  RANGERS EXTEND A'S TAILSPIN
BULLPEN FAILS TO HOLD BACK TEXAS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The A's have dropped nine of 12, and they're continuing to slide in the
American League West standings. The California Angels slipped ahead of the A's
on Wednesday, moving into second, a game ahead of the A's. The A's remained 4
1/2 games behind the Minnesota Twins, their biggest deficit since they trailed
Minnesota by five games on Oct. 12, 1987.;    The A's are only a half-game
ahead of the Rangers and a game ahead of the fifth-place Seattle Mariners.;   
Everything hinged Wednesday on left fielder Rickey Henderson's error in the
Rangers' six-run seventh.;    After Curt Young walked lead-off hitter Ruben
Sierra, Gene Nelson came in to face Julio Franco. First baseman Mark McGwire
tried to turn a double play, but shortstop Mike Gallego's throw back to first
was short.;    With a runner on first and one out, Kevin Reimer singled to
left and Henderson overran the ball. His error allowed Franco to advance to
third and Reimer to take second. With first base open, the A's opted to
intentionally walk Juan Gonzalez.;    And Steve Beuchele promptly cleared the
bases with his three-run triple to the gap in left-center. Nelson was
staggering. La Russa finally came and got him after three more hits and three
more runs.;    His line: a third of an inning, five hits, five runs and an
intentional walk.;    Beuchele drove in a run in the eighth, when the A's
again intentionally walked Gonzalez to load the bases.;    There was nothing
in Moore's past performances that indicated La Russa should have waited,
either. On June 12, La Russa lifted Moore after six one-hit innings against
the Detroit Tigers because Moore threw a combined 67 pitches in the fifth and
sixth innings and walked five. On June 17 in Milwaukee, Moore gave up a hit
and a walk before surrendering five fifth-inning runs.;    Perhaps most
significantly, Moore threw a lot of pitches in going eight innings in a 3-2
loss to the Boston Red Sox last Friday.;    When he's on the mound at the
Coliseum, Moore gives the A's what they need. The road remains a different
story. Coming into Wednesday's start, Moore was 6-1 with a 2.68 ERA at home in
47 innings and 2-5 with a 5.55 ERA in 47 road innings.;    And Moore was
dead-on Wednesday, sharp enough to strike out five batters in the first three
innings and sharp enough to not allow a hit until Rafael Palmeiro lined a
one-out single to left on a 1-and-0 count in the fourth.;    The Rangers'
Kevin Brown groped for the strike zone early. He walked six batters in the
first four innings, but the A's didn't score until the fourth.;    With two
out, Brown walked Ernest Riles and Jamie Quirk, and Lance Blankenship hit an
RBI single to right-center. Mike Gallego grounded out to strand runners at
first and second.; ETC.: The Rangers' Dean Palmer, who hit 22 homers for
Triple-A Oklahoma City before he was called up Monday, batted lead off.
Palmer's 22 homers led pro baseball. He was hitting .299 with 59 RBIs in 60
games. He singled in the seventh.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  The A's are free-falling in the American League West, desperately searching
for a rip cord.;    But there's no breaking this fall right now. The A's
bullpen continued to pitch woefully Thursday, and the Texas Rangers left town
with a 9-6 win, a sweep in the three-game series and third place in the West.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THERE'S NO RELIEF FROM A'S FALL
OAKLAND DROPS TO 4TH PLACE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The A's have lost 10 of their last 13, and they've dropped to fourth place
in the West. Fourth place. That doesn't have a nice ring to it, if you're the
three-time American League champs. The A's haven't been in fourth this late in
the season since Aug. 12, 1987.;    "The world's not going to end. We've been
in tighter spots," said right fielder Jose Canseco, who did his part with a
single, double and homer No. 17. "There's still a half season to go.";    At
least A's Manager Tony La Russa was satisfied with his club's effort Thursday.
He held a team meeting Wednesday night because he didn't think some of the A's
tried hard enough in an 8-1 loss.;    Much of the responsibility for the A's
recent failures belongs to the bullpen. The A's were hanging on until they
could get Todd Burns, Rick Honeycutt and Gene Nelson back from extended
disabled list stints. But now that they're back, A's relievers aren't pitching
well.;    In fact, now there's no one to provide a bridge to closer Dennis
Eckersley because Joe Klink, the A's most dependable middle reliever, suffered
a broken foot June 5.;    The relievers' ERA in the last two games is 17.19.
Their ERA during this 13-game stretch is 6.62.;    The A's were winning 3-2
when starter Andy Hawkins departed in the sixth. Honeycutt served up Dean
Palmer's first major league homer, a two-run shot. Steve Chitren let an
inherited runner score and was rocked for three more on Steve Buechele's homer
in the seventh.;    In turn, Johnny Guzman let one of Chitren's runners score
in the eighth.;    "It's the major leagues. What succeeds here is mental
toughness," La Russa said. "If the only time that you're good is when you get
base hits, score runs or get people out, then you're not going to have a very
long, productive career. So they've just got to hang with it.;    "As long as
the manager doesn't lose confidence and the pitching coach doesn't lost
confidence, there's no reason for them to. . . . I believe in the ability out
there.";    And it still might be too early to expect consistent pitching from
the relievers coming off the D.L.;    "You're looking at the whole middle
relief corps coming back at one time, basically," Honeycutt said. "I'm not
making any excuses, but one time you're going to look good, and the next time
you're not going to look that good.";    So, that doesn't explain whyChitren
is having a miserable time. He has allowed 11 of 29 inherited runners to score
this season. But pitching coach Dave Duncan says it's all related.;    "Those
guys (Burns, Honeycutt and Nelson) basically are having to go through spring
training again, competing at the major league level," he said. "Johnny
Guzman's a rookie pitcher. You can only expect so much from him.;    "Steve
Chitren. . . . He's a rookie pitcher. We're putting him in situations that are
normally reserved for guys like Gene Nelson, when he's in top form, and Rick
Honeycutt, when he's in top form.";    Duncan has said all along it might take
until the All-Star break before the returning relievers pitch consistently
well. "We'll get better. Can't get worse."; HOW THEY SCORED;    Rangers 2nd --

<HEAD>US Influence in Europe Would Drop Sharply Without Troops: German</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf of 2nd item, bgng, The six ... to CORRECT that
the crewmen have been identified</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will suffer a sharp loss of
influence in Europe if Americans withdraw their troops, West German
Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg says.
   ``In the past, American cooperation and influence on European
policy was helpful, and in future, American policy and influence in
Europe can be helpful,'' Stoltenberg said Tuesday evening.
   ``But without any soldiers or significant (numbers of) soldiers,
your influence in all matters of security policy will sharply
decline,'' he added. ``And I doubt whether this is desirable.''
   Stoltenberg said in a speech before the American Institute for
Contemporary German Studies of the Johns Hopkins University that
Americans should maintain a substantial military presence for the
foreseeable future.
   He said the United States might be able to reduce its forces in
Central Europe beyond the 195,000 troops proposed by President
Bush, if that could be coordinated with European allies and the
Soviet Union.
   The defense minister met with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
earlier Tuesday, and they discussed German unification and other
European issues, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said.
   A Pentagon source who spoke on background said the officials
discussed problems with East-West talks in Vienna to cut
conventional forces in Europe. He declined to say what the problems
were.
   Stoltenberg called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to
retain nuclear forces in Europe, but said their numbers should be
greatly reduced.

<HEAD>Army Seeking Next of Kin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is looking for the next of kin for
six crewmen who died when their B-17 was lost on a 1942 patrol over
the Coral Sea, officials say.
   Although the aircraft was found and the crew list confirmed
after several research missions to Papua New Guinea in 1986 and
1987, relatives of six of the eight crewmen haven't been found,
Shari Lawrence, spokeswoman for the U.S. Total Army Personnel
Command, said Tuesday.
   The plane disappeared after leaving from Townsville in
Queensland, Australia. The Army believes the crew encountered the
enemy because the Battle of the Coral Sea occurred in the days
immediately after its disappearance, the statement said.
   The six crewmen whose next of kin haven't been found are:
   _2nd Lt. Jim Sam Grant, born Jan. 28, 1918. Last known next of
kin: father Walter C. Grant, Malvern, Ark., and mother Marian P.
Grant, Tucson, Ariz.
   _2nd Lt. Robert R. Meyer, Jr., birthdate unknown. Last known
next of kin was father Robert R. Meyer, Birmingham, Ala.
   _Staff Sgt. Elton J. Rose, birthdate unknown. Last known next of
kin was wife Gladys Strickland Rose, Coleman, Texas.
   _Sgt. Joe A. Carter, born May 10, 1910. Last known next of kin
was mother Hazel Williams, La Jolla, Calif.
   _Sgt. Edward L. Hargrove, birthdate unknown. Last known next of
kin were wife Evelyn W. Hargrove, Albuquerque, N.M., and
grandfather, Manuel E. Flores, El Centro, Calif.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Bank Eased Loan Terms For Sen. Durenberger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger received loans totaling
nearly $1 million from Commercial State Bank of St. Paul without
collateral and at very low interest from 1979 through 1988, the
Star Tribune reported today.
   Durenberger denied any impropriety.
   Durenberger's personal finances are under investigation by the
Senate Ethics Committee, and the loan information could open a new
avenue of inquiry. Durenberger did not fully disclose some of the
loans as required by Senate rules, the newspaper said.
   The Minnesota Republican's cousin Jack is a vice president in
the bank's commercial lending section, but the senator's staff said
today that Jack Durenberger had nothing to do with the loans.
   ``He had absolutely no involvement in any of the loan
transactions for the senator,'' the senator's press secretary,
Carrie Collins, told The Associated Press.
   Durenberger received 23 loans, most not backed by collateral,
totaling $927,078 from the bank after entering the Senate in 1978,
the newspaper reported.
   The interest rates on many of the loans through 1981 were so low
that industry experts suggested they may not have been profitable
for the bank, the Star Tribune said.
   About half the 23 loans were below the prime lending rate banks
traditionally give their most valued customers.
   Bank officials said the loans were routine for a good customer.
   Six banking experts contacted by the Star Tribune said many of
the loans appeared to be outside standard banking practices.
   The loan history ``doesn't make any sense from a banker's point
of view,'' said Michael Pint, a former state banking commissioner.
   Pint and other experts who commented on the loans weren't told
the identity of the bank or the name of the borrower, but knew it
was a political figure, the newspaper said.
   ``If it happened at my bank, heads would roll,'' said Jim
Burkholder, chief operating officer of Investors Savings Bank in
Minneapolis. ``It's not prudent to do that ... and based on what
I've seen, it appears it smacks of seeking to influence a public
official.''
   ``You just don't make loans like that because they are losers,''
said Pint, president of Central Financial Services and former chief
finance officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
   Bert McKasy, Durenberger's chief of staff, provided details of
the loans to the Star Tribune and set up an interview with
Commercial State's president.
   McKasy said Durenberger did nothing wrong in obtaining the loans
and simply took the best interest rate available.
   Bank officials said they gave the loans to Durenberger because
he was a good customer and because they hoped he might return to
Minnesota after leaving office and promote the bank to his friends.
   Bank officials said they never contacted Durenberger for help in
his official role.
   ``We feel our relationship was absolutely above board. It was a
very typical relationship,'' said Bank Chairman Victor Reim.
   Bank President Richard Kastner said Commercial State was never
at risk.
   Durenberger, who refused to be interviewed, provided a written
statement outlining his relationship with the bank. He called Reim
a close friend and said he began banking at Commercial in 1975.
   ``I never asked for any special consideration from the bank and
don't believe I was ever extended any,'' Durenberger said.

<HEAD>Chirac Pulling Ahead In Crucial Race For Second Place</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REIMS, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Jacques Chirac, long mired in third
place in opinion polls, has seen his presidential campaign take
off, giving him an edge over rival conservative Raymond Barre with
two months left before the vote.
   The first round of the election, April 24, has become in effect
a primary election between Chirac and Barre. Unless there is a
stunning turnaround, one of the two will oppose a Socialist,
probably incumbent President Francois Mitterrand, in the decisive
May 8 runoff for a seven-year term.
   Policy differences between Chirac and Barre are few and minor,
so the campaign has focused on the contrasting personalities of the
two men, and what their political advisers increasingly call ``le
look.''
   There is certainly no need for the voters to discover the
candidates _ Mitterrand has been a major national figure for 40
years, Barre and Chirac for 15 years each.
   ``It's a question of sentiment, who looks better and talks
better,'' said Bertrand Louapre, a Barre supporter interviewed on
the edges of a cocktail reception during a Chirac campaign swing
Wednesday through Reims, capital of the Champagne country northeast
of Paris.
   ``Personally, I've chosen Raymond Barre,'' said Louapre, a
construction engineer. ``Mr. Chirac has certainly taken off faster.
He has much stronger support from his party.''
   Chirac, a rangy, almost hyperactive figure, then displayed his
formidable skills as a campaigner, moving swiftly through the
crowd, but often stopping to grasp the hands of his supporters
briefly in his own oversized hands.
   ``I think the premier is closer to people, and that's what will
make him win,'' political science professor Alain Redslob, author
of a book on Chirac, said in an interview. ``I think there's a
strong movement beginning to lift off.''
   ``The Barre style is that of a fairly cold man, who has wanted
to give himself an image of rigor,'' Bernard Pons, Chirac's
minister of overseas territories, recently said in a radio
interview. ``He is a man who is fairly secret and who ...
frequently makes decisions alone.''
   Barre, a rotund economics professor who had never run for public
office when he began his five-year term as premier in 1976, is
widely respected but inspires little enthusiasm. He prides himself
on telling people what they need to know, whether or not they want
to hear it.
   ``They tell me to offer the French people a dream,'' Barre told
a campaign rally in the southwestern city of Poitiers on Wednesday.
``But to dream, one must first go to sleep. I love my country too
much, I respect my fellow citizens too much to lend myself to
that.''
   Barre says Chirac's government, which took over from the
Socialists in March 1986, has made some good moves. He says he
would take stronger action to boost French industry.
   Mitterrand has long had a solid lead in all published opinion
surveys, while Chirac trailed Barre thoughout last year. A poll
published Jan. 16, the day Chirac declared his candidacy, gave
Mitterrand 41 percent to 25 percent for Barre and 18.5 percent for
Chirac.
   But surveys published in the past two weeks have shown Chirac
pushing ahead. Friday's edition of the magazine Paris-Match, for
exampale, reported 23 percent of those questioned planning to vote
for Chirac, to 19 percent for Barre. Mitterrand, who says he will
wait until mid-March to disclose his plans, remained far ahead with
36 percent.
   The questions were posed for Paris-Match and a radio network by
the polling firm B.V.A., which between Feb. 1-4 interviewed 1,316
people who said they intended to vote. No margin of error was
disclosed.
   Barre, who insists on his independence from all political
parties, is supported by the Union for French Democracy, a loose
grouping of five center-right parties that is part of Chirac's
governing coalition.
   The main event of Chirac's five-hour visit to Reims was a
campaign rally that drew 7,000 supporters to a new exposition hall
in the suburbs. Many arrived in buses chartered by Chirac's party,
the Rally for the Republic, France's most efficient political
machine.
   Rather than give a speech, Chirac answered questions from three
men and two women chosen to raise issues of concern in the region.
   He defended France's agricultural policies and promised to
improve schools and universities so that students learn skills they
need to find jobs. He also said he hoped to increase family
allowances to mothers of three or more children to the minimum
wage, about $825 a month, ``because they deserve it.''
   The first question asked of Chirac, who is juggling duties as
mayor of Paris, premier of France and member of a regional council
in south-central France, was how he can do all the work.
   ``I'm an optimist by nature,'' he replied, ``which probably
gives me more energy to face problems.''

<TEXT>     It was Stewart's first loss at home this season.;    The defeat dropped the
A's into a second-place tie with California in the American League West, 4 1/2
games behind Minnesota.;    Stewart's miseries continued, as he allowed six
earned runs and 10 hits in seven innings against the league's second-best
hitting team.;    He didn't strike out a batter after the first inning and
retired the side in order only in the fifth.;    The most piercing blow was a
three-run home run by Juan Gonzalez with two out in the seventh, a drive that
cleared the center-field fence and put the game out of reach. Gonzalez
increased his season totals to 10 homers and 49 RBIs.;    Stewart was lifted
after throwing 126 pitches.;    The numbers keep growing uglier for Stewart
(4-4), whose quest for a fifth consecutive season of at least 20 victories has
virtually dissolved.;    In his past six starts, Stewart has allowed 32 earned
runs in 40 1/3 innings. His ERA rose to 5.89 and he's allowed 58 earned runs
this season, the most in the American League.;    The A's averaged nearly 6.5
runs in Stewart's 13 previous starts this season. He blew two leads in his
last start at Boston but didn't receive a lead to work with this time.;    He
surrendered three runs in the third inning, and the damage could have been
more severe.;    Brian Downing ripped a 2-and-0 fastball for a single. Rafael
Palmeiro drew a walk and stayed at first as Ruben Sierra flied out to right.; 
  But Julio Franco struck the first blow for the Rangers, hitting a single
past a diving Mark McGwire at first base to score Downing. Franco then stole
second base, and he and Palmeiro scored on a single by Kevin Reimer.;    Mike
Gallego couldn't handle Lance Blankenship's throw on a force attempt at second
base and was charged with an error. But Gallego made amends for his muff by
starting a double play to end the rally.;    Texas catcher Ivan Rodriguez, at
19 the youngest player in the major leagues, hit singles in his first three
at-bats against Stewart.;    Rodriguez started a promising rally when he led
off the fourth with a single and moved to third on a wild pitch and a
groundout.;    With two out, Stewart walked Palmeiro. It appeared to be costly
when Sierra hit a hard drive to left-center.;    But left fielder Rickey
Henderson reached across his body to make a diving catch.;    The A's couldn't
muster much offense against Jose Guzman (2-3). They managed seven hits but
didn't put a leadoff man on base in eight of their innings.;    They scratched
a run in the third, thanks to the bottom of the order. Gallego singled to
right and scored on Blankenship's first-pitch double.;    Rickey Henderson
drew a walk, but the rally ended when Dave Henderson took a called third
strike and Jose Canseco and Harold Baines hit into force-outs at second.;

FT  06 JUL 92 / Arts: Il viaggio a Reims - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This piece d'occasion was devised by Rossini to celebrate the 1825
coronation of Charles X, allowed to disappear into obscurity immediately
afterwards and then re-discovered after a gap of nearly 160 years.
The first ever Royal Opera production has been mounted to mark several
milestones. One is the composer's own 200th anniversary, which fell on
February 29. (In the opera's finale, originally a hymn to Charles X, the
name of Rossini replaces the king's in Balocchi's libretto and on the
singers' lips, while his bust set atop a circling globe descends from the
flies.) Another is the start of Britain's tenure of the EC presidency. A
third is the launch of the six-month-long, cross-Britain European Arts
Festival linked to the presidency; the festival administration sponsored
Saturday's big screen relay in the Covent Garden piazza.
These are all worthy ventures, significant occasions in their own right, so
it is painful to have to report that three hours and 15 minutes of the most
god-awful tomfoolery are being dished up for their benefit. In brief, the
work is reduced in John Cox's production and Mark Thompson's designs to a
series of bone-achingly tedious farcical sketches; the peculiar beauty,
verve, charm and delicacy of the music are positively scarred by the stage
routines.
The excitement of the Viaggio a Reims re-discovery lay in large part in the
delighted recognition that the cantata scenica was no sample of 'occasional'
artificiality but a fabulous piece of Rossinian compositorial ingenuity and,
furthermore, a light-as-air comic divertissement, set in a spa hotel, with
two substantial linked purposes at its core. These were the celebration of
the coronation via the singing powers of ten of the Italian vocal virtuosos
of his day; and the creation of a vision of human peace, concord and harmony
that makes the work at once historically special and universal.
Covent Garden have undertaken their interpretation of these purposes with
perfect wrongheadedness. The casting of the ten principal roles is, to put
it bluntly, inadequate; and the light-as-air comedy is transmogrified into a
tacky hotel caper firmly rooted in tired musicals and telly spectaculars
equally.
There are two John Coxes. Jekyll-Cox is a civilised and intelligent producer
capable (in the Glyndebourne Capriccio and ENO Cosi) of elegant ensemble
performance. Hyde-Cox is a farceur capable (in the Glyndebourne Cenerentola)
of the most coarse-grained vulgarity.
The Viaggio producer is Hyde-Cox, inventor of a string of much-repeated
sight-gags: the exercising spa-patron gag, the dancing bellhops in yellow
gag, the revolving door gag, the hooped petticoat gag, the hat gag, the
apple gag, the English milord with his Scots flautist (]) gag, the St
Trinian schoolgirls in specs with bowls of flowers gag, the luggage gag, the
can-can gag, the Danish flag gag, and so on and on and on. (There is no
Maastricht gag: some mistake surely . . .)
The idea that the notes and words could serve as the opera's dramatic
vehicle seems not to have entered Cox's head. The costumes are loudly
coloured, extravagantly cut and typescreaming 'Comic Character]' so
frenetically that any effort at wit or vivacity of delivery on the part of
the people inside them is rendered entirely nugatory.
My guess is that people who come to know the opera through this first Covent
Garden staging - rather than through the 1984 DG 'premiere' recording or the
Guildhall School's enchanting 1987 student production - will come to wonder
why the company wasted time, energy and money on tackling it at all. After
the Guildhall performance I wrote that it seemed 'likely to leave (at least)
one London Rossinian with a blissful smile on his face for days afterwards';
that the opposite can confidently be predicted of this Covent Garden
experience is perhaps the greatest outrage of all.
Two of the ten principal singers might be called native Rossinians (though
both seem some way beyond their best singing days): Della Jones as Melibea
and Montserrat Caballe as the hotel patronne. Mme Caballe indulges in an ad
lib relationship with the audience that begins amusingly but soon turns
embarrassing; I feel sorry that this undignified, vocally fragile appearance
may well provide the house with its final memories of one of the century's
great singers.
The rest can be catalogued as follows: one tenor (John Aler) of at least
neat, musicianly vocal style, two sopranos (the gorgeous-toned Renee
Fleming, the gently musical Sylvia McNair) who might in other circumstances
have been guided to less unconvincing Rossini vocal manners, one hugely
promising bass (Alastair Miles) no less ill-served - and a group of
admirable Anglo-Saxon singing-actors entirely out of their Fach.
The fact that there are no Italians in the cast is a general error and a
particular weakness in the case of the buffo roles. The conductor, Carlo
Rizzi, is Italian, and a trimly energetic musician - but also an unloving
one, who rushes the ensembles unmercifully and who finds neither grace nor
gaiety in Rossini phrasing. The Royal Opera have offered a run of
high-quality performances this season. Sad that it should be broken, and the
season concluded, with this absolute turkey.
Sponsored by Friends of Covent Garden; in repertory until July 17.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Motoring through France: Coping with the autoroute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST time my wife and I drove to the south of France we went in our VW
Beetle. It took the best part of three days, with two overnight stops.
If nearly three days seems a long time to get from Calais to Le Lavandou,
remember that in the early 1960s there was virtually no autoroute in France.
Most of the N-roads (routes nationales) had changed little since Napoleon
had lined them with plane trees to shade marching troops from the sun.
Stretches of cobblestones were still in place which is why French cars were
noted for their soft seats and resilient suspensions.
Driving through France on the autoroutes is now so easy - and even the
cheapest family-type cars so good - that a determined driver can make the
700 miles (1125 kms) from Calais to the Mediterranean in a single day. But I
would not recommend it. For a solo driver, more than 12 hours at the wheel
almost non-stop has to be fatiguing. And for the unfortunte passengers, a
feat of endurance. They are, after all, supposed to be on holiday, too.
Before anyone reaches for pen or phone to tell me how they have driven from
Calais to the Mediterranean in ten hours or less, I would say this.
You may (like me) have got away with cruising naughtily at well over 100 mph
(160 kph) on the autoroute in the past but you are unlikely be so lucky
today. Enforcement of the 81 mph (130 kmh) limit that drops to 110 kmh or 68
mph in wet weather grows stricter by the month, as speeding Britons are
finding to their considerable cost.
Quite apart from the on-the-spot fine, remember that the delay while the
police do the paperwork (and where was your grandmother born, monsieur?)
will ruin your average speed anyway.
So where to stop overnight? Assuming a mid-morning Dover-Calais crossing,
Avallon is convenient. It is almost at half distance between Calais and,
say, Marseille.
Which hotel? As you will be spending your own money, not a company's, try
the Relais Fleuri. Leave the A6 at Avallon, take the first right after the
peage and in three minutes it is on your right. We discovered it about 15
years ago. Our usual Avallon hotel, the Chapeau Rouge - not expensive, even
though the restaurant used to have one star in Michelin's Red Guide - had
been going downhill. It was time for a change. Relais Fleuri, a simple motel
with a restaurant in an old farmhouse, was cheap, comfortable and
convenient. Now it is twice the size, no longer so cheap (about Pounds 75
for a double room and dinner) but still fair value. Be on the road by 9 am,
do not linger over lunch and you should be in good time to dine anywhere
between Narbonne in the west or Menton in the east.
This assumes all goes well on the autoroute. It probably will if you avoid
weekend travel, especially on the Paris-Lyon A6 and Lyon-Marseille A7,
between mid-July and the end of August. They become so congested that rush
hour travel on our own M25 London Orbital motorway seems quite tranquil by
comparison.
What about the dreaded Paris peripherique? It is often, but not always, a
thrombotic ordeal. A north-south driver can dodge some of it by leaving the
A6 just after Charles de Gaulle airport, taking the A3 and joining the
peripherique at porte de Bagnolet. On a good day it is then only 15-20
minutes to porte d'Italie and the easily missed slip road for the southbound
A6 to Lyon.
If you have great confidence in your navigator, miss the perepherique
altogether by going from the A3 to the A86 and then the N186 which connects
with the A6 just north of Orly airport. Be sure to have a good map such as
Michelin's spiral bound motoring atlas of France. I would not cross the
Channel without mine - or its companion, the Red Guide to French hotels and
restaurants.
The good news is that from June 19 it will not even be necessary to take the
busy A1 and A6 autoroute for most of a fast drive to the south. The
long-awaited missing link in the A26 between Chalons and Troyes is due to
open that day.
This lightly used autoroute joins the A5 near Langres and continues south as
the A31, by-passing Dijon and connecting with the A6 at Beaune. Think of it
as a French equivalent of the M40 extension, which lets people like me reach
Birmingham from south of the Thames without going near the M1.
The 202 miles (325 kms) of the A26 from Chalons to Calais via Reims must be
one of Europe's easiest drives. Returning from Geneva a couple of months ago
there was so little traffic from Reims onward that I set the cruise control
at 140 kph (86 mph) - just a wee bit over the limit  - and left it untouched
for more than an hour. Try doing that on any British motorway.
I have no favourite stopover in the Champagne country but recommend lunch or
dinner at La Terasse in Epernay. It has just one knife and fork in Michelin
but a three-course tourist menu of good quality is stylishly presented and
costs little more than a decent pub lunch in Britain. Going to Epernay means
leaving the autoroute but I reckon La Terasse is worth the detour.
French motorways are really quite civilized even if driving behaviour on
them is sometimes anything but. There are frequent stopping places with loos
and picnic tables. At the big service areas you can eat pretty well.
Britain's motorway restaurants lost their greasy spoon and
chips-with-everything reputation long ago. But I still look forward to lunch
at a l'Arche or a Court Paille cafeteria on the autoroute more than I would
at a similar place on a British motorway.
You pay a toll to use French motorways, except those around big cities like
Paris. At the moment, driving a car from Calais to Marseille costs FFr284
(about Pounds 30) in tolls, more if you tow a caravan or trailer. A credit
card like Visa or Access does nicely at the peages.
But why rush down to the Mediterranean as quickly as possible? A more
leisurely journey by N and D (departmental) roads will prove it really can
be better to travel than to arrive.
The main and minor roads of France carry much less traffic than their
English (though perhaps not Welsh or Scottish) equivalents. Most of them are
very well surfaced. Signposting is easy to follow once you get used to the
idea that an arrow pointing to the left or right may actually mean you go
straight on.
You will save on tolls but spend a lot more time and, of course, more on
overnight accommodation. But who knows? Thirty years from now you may
remember every detail of your slow trip to the Mediterranean. The quick ones
you may prefer to forget.
If you are taking your car across the English Channel by the short sea route
from Dover to Calais. P &amp; 0 and Sealink Stena have their best ships on the
run - superferries almost as big as ocean-going liners.
Use club class if you are not going to eat and consider a few pounds extra
worth spending to be able to read the papers and drink coffee (both free) in
the peace and quiet of a nicely furnished lounge.
Hovercraft (from about 35 minutes) are faster but that is about the only
thing in their favour.

DONATELLI FINISHES WHAT SAPERGIA STARTS AS GULLS TOP KANSAS CITY

A tap dance might be appropriate, but leave the heavy combat boots at home. 
This was more Fred and Ginger than Rambo. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls (7-7-2) tickled and teased 3,647 fans Thursday night before winning 
their third home game of the season, a 6-3 International Hockey League victory 
over last-place Kansas City (2-12-0) at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Sapergia, the driver of the Gulls sometimes mean, sometimes lean -- 
always unpredictable -- scoring machine, scored twice early and set the tone as 
the Gulls jumped to a 4-2 lead after two periods. 
</P>
<P>
But Kansas City reeled in the Gulls and controlled much of the third period, 
before a breakaway goal from center ice by Clark Donatelli sent a collective 
sigh of relief through the crowd and gave the Gulls a 5-3 lead at 13:15 in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"We stopped skating in the third," Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell said. "We were 
lucky to get that goal by Donatelli. We have to come out (tonight, when the 
Gulls gain play Kansas City) and skate a lot better than we did (Thursday), or 
we'll be in a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls started the third with a 4-2 lead, but Scott White scored at 5:24 
pull Kansas City within one. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Glen Halon kept a seemingly inevitable tying goal out of the net 
when he stopped Kansas City's Mike Hiltner on a breakaway at 11:45. 
</P>
<P>
Donatelli, who hadn't been heard from since his second two-goal game Oct. 26 
against Salt Lake, gave the Gulls a 3-1 lead on the power play at 7:24 in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls were 0-for-3 on the power play before Donatelli scored from the left 
wing on a two-on-one perfect pass from Steve Martinson. Donatelli sent the to 
the top corner of the net, giving him his third two-goal game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Martinson chalked up his second assist of the night, his fifth in the last two 
games, on a bizarre play, courtesy of Donatelli. 
</P>
<P>
From the right circle, Donatelli passed to Martinson, who waited in the left 
wing, only to have his shot deflected. It ended up on the stick of teammate 
Darcy Norton, who scored from the slot at 15:31, making it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, with the Gulls' Taylor Hall on the bench for a slashing 
penalty, Jeff Jablonski scored his second goal on the night to pull Kansas City 
to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sluggish," said Sapergia, who now has 13 goals for the season. "I've 
never seen a team like this. We're terrible at home, and great on the road. I 
don't know, we just didn't have that killer instinct."

Jablonski gave Kansas City the early 1-0 advantage, scoring 1:54 into the game 
from outside the left wing, on a delayed penalty against the Gulls.

<P>
Something about playing catch-up has this strange appeal to the Gulls, who are 
the worst in the league in first goals allowed. They own the IHL record, with 
13 allowed in 16 games.

<P>
After that was out of their system, Sapergia came in and scored the Gulls' 
first two goals, the first at 3:33 on a breakaway from the slot and the second 
at 7:20. A muffed attempt from the right wing made its way to Larry Floyd, who 
passed from the left circle, who tapped in the goal for the 2-0 lead.

Kansas City pulled its goalie with 33 seconds remaining, and Martinson scored 
on a slapshot from the left point with 23 seconds left to make it 6-3.

Gulls Notes 
</P>
<P>
There in spirit: Charlie Simmer, the Gulls' left wing/assistant coach, was 
unable to attend the retiring of former Los Angeles King teammate Marcel 
Dionne's number Thursday night at The Forum, but he did attend a dinner 
Wednesday night to honor Dionne, who along with Simmer and Dave Taylor, made up 
the famous "Triple Crown Line," of the early 1980s. . . . Double good: Kansas 
City's Jeff Jablonski, who scored the Golden Blades' first goal Thursday, has a 
twin brother, Pat, in the IHL. Pat is league-leading Peoria's No. 2 goaltender. 
. . . The road can be lonely, as Kansas City is finding out. Entering 
Thursday's game, the Blades were winless on the road (0-4) and are only three 
games into a 10-game trip. . . . Goalie Mark Reimer, who is the property of 
Detroit, was loaned to Adirondack Thursday, the Red Wings' top farm team. 
Reimer, 23, was 3-2-1 and had a 4.28 goals-against average this season. The 
Gulls have two goalies on their roster: Glen Hanlon and Scott Brower. . . . 
Promotions: The first 2,500 fans to arrive at tonight's game will receive 
souvenir keychains.
